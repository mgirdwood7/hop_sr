Sixty‐eight patients were clinically evaluated preoperatively, 3, 5, 7, 9 months, 1 and 2 years after ACL reconstruction, 34 with patellar tendon graft, 34 with hamstring graft. Outcome regarding graft choice and anterior knee laxity (P = 0.04) was in favour of patellar tendon graft. Hamstring graft led to a larger laxity, 2.4 mm compared with patellar tendon graft, 1.3 mm at 1 year and 2.5 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively, at 2 years (P = 0.05). There was a significant difference in rotational knee stability in favour of the patellar tendon graft at all test occasions but 9 months. A general effect regarding graft choice and muscle torque was found at 90 degrees/s for quadriceps (P = 0.03) and hamstrings (P < or = 0.0001) and at 230 degrees/s for hamstrings (P < or = 0.0001). No treatment effect regarding graft choice and one‐leg hop test, postural sway or knee function was found. No group differences in anterior knee pain were found at any of the test occasions but 2 years in favour of hamstring graft compared to patellar tendon graft (P = 0.04). Patellar tendon graft resulted in higher activity level than hamstring graft at all test occasions but 1 year (P = 0.01). Patellar tendon ACL reconstruction led to more stable knees with less anterior knee laxity and less rotational instability than hamstring ACL reconstruction. Hamstring graft patients had not reached preoperative level in hamstring torque even 2 years after ACL reconstruction. Athletes with patellar tendon graft returned to sports earlier and at a higher level than those with hamstring graft.

Purpose: The aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare objective and subjective outcome in patients 2 and 5 years after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with either bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) or hamstring grafts. The second aim was to report the prevalence of re- and contralateral ACL ruptures.Methods: Sixty-eight patients (BPTB, n = 34 and hamstring graft, n = 34) were evaluated preoperatively, 2 and 5 years after ACL reconstruction. Anterior knee laxity and rotational knee joint stability, muscle torque, hop length, anterior knee pain, activity level and self-reported knee function and quality of life were evaluated within and between groups. The prevalence of re- and contralateral ACL ruptures was also recorded.Results: No significant difference in anterior knee laxity, rotational knee joint stability, hop length anterior knee pain or knee function and quality of life were noted at the 5-year follow-up. No significant differences in concentric or eccentric quadriceps torque at 90°/s and 230°/s were found at any of the follow-ups between and within grafts. A significant group difference in hamstring torque 1.05 (0.02) for BPTB and 0.89 (0.02) for hamstring grafts, and in hop length (leg symmetry index) follow-up 0.94 (0.07) for BPTB compared to 0.99 (0.07) for hamstring grafts (P = 0.002) was found at the 2 year follow-up in favour of the BPTB graft, but not at the 5 year follow-up. A significant improvement over time, irrespective of graft, was found in the KOOS's subscales Sport/Rec and quality of life (P < 0.001). None of the patients, irrespective of group, returned to their pre-injury level of sport (P < 0.05). Over the five postoperative years, one man and eight women (13 %) (hamstring graft, n = 5 and BPTB graft, n = 4), sustained a total of 11 (16.2 %) new ACL ruptures: seven (10.2 %) re-ruptures and four (5.9 %) ruptures of the contralateral ACL.Conclusions: At the 5-year follow-up, there were no significant differences in terms of anterior knee laxity, rotational knee joint stability, muscle torque, anterior knee pain, hop performance, quality of life or activity level between patients who had undergone reconstruction with BPTB or hamstring grafts. None of the patients, irrespective of group, had returned to their pre-injury level of activity. Eight out of the nine patients who had sustained a second ACL rupture were women.

Purpose: To compare isometric hamstring strength deficits, knee laxity, functional outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes between patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with doubled semitendinosus and gracilis tendon autograft (ST/G) versus quadrupled semitendinosus autograft (ST), at a minimum follow-up of 1-year postoperatively.Methods: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with ST/G or ST hamstring autografts were retrospectively identified. Isometric hamstring strength was tested with a hand-held dynamometer at 30, 60, and 90° of knee flexion. Anterior knee laxity was assessed using a KT-1000 arthrometer. Functional outcomes were collected using the single-leg hop test and single-leg squat test. Side-to-side differences were determined and compared between the ST/G and ST groups. Patient-reported outcomes were collected on all patients.Results: Eighty-four patients who underwent ST/G (n = 34) or ST (n = 50) autograft ACL reconstruction were recruited to participate in this study. There was no difference in knee laxity between the groups. Side-to-side hamstring strength deficits increased with increased flexion angles. At 90° of flexion, the ST/G group had a significantly greater flexion strength deficit compared with the ST group (37.8 ± 15.1% vs 24.7 ± 12.5%, P < .001). Aside from a significant difference in the KOOS pain Score (P .045), no other significant differences in functional or patient reported outcomes between the groups were identified.Conclusions: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with ST/G compared with ST autograft have a significantly greater isometric flexion strength deficit at 90° of flexion. Future investigations are required to determine the clinical relevance of this difference and whether specialized therapy protocols can mitigate this deficit.Level Of Evidence: Level III, retrospective comparative study.

BACKGROUND: Hop tests are frequently used to determine return to sports (RTS) after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Given that bilateral deficits are present after ACLR, this may result in a falsely high limb symmetry index (LSI), since LSI is calculated as a ratio between the values of the limbs., HYPOTHESIS: Athletes after ACLR would achieve LSI>90% for the hop test. Secondly, athletes after ACLR demonstrate decreased jump distance on the single hop for distance (SLH) and triple leg hop for distance (TLH) and decreased number of hops for the side hop (SH) for both involved and uninvolved limbs compared to normative data of sex, age and type of sports matched healthy athletes., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients (38 males mean age 23.9+/-3.5years; 14 females mean age 21.7+/-3.5 years) who had undergone an ACLR participated in this study. Patients performed the 3 hop tests at a mean time of 7 months after ACLR. Hop distance, number of side hops and LSI were compared with normative data of 188 healthy athletes., RESULTS: The differences between the involved limb and the uninvolved limb were significant in all hop tests (SLH P=0.003, TLH P=0.003, SH P=0.018). For females, only significant between limb differences were found in the SLH (P=0.049). For both the SLH and the TLH, significant differences were found between the involved limb and the normative data (males; SLH P<0.001, TLH P<0.001; females; SLH P<0.001, TLH P=0.006) and between the uninvolved limb and the normative data for both males and females (males; SLH P<0.001, TLH P<0.001; females; SLH P=0.003, TLH P=0.038). For the SH, only significant differences were found between the involved limb and the normative values in males (P=0.033)., CONCLUSION: Athletes who have undergone an ACLR demonstrate bilateral deficits on hop tests in comparison to age and sex matched normative data of healthy controls. Using the LSI may underestimate performance deficits and should therefore be analyzed with caution when used as a criterion for RTS after ACLR., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, case control study.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between self-reported knee outcomes and limb symmetry indices (LSIs) for hip and knee strength, postural control and single-leg hop distance in individuals who had undergone an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction via hamstring tendon autograft (HTG)., METHODS: A total of 72 participants with a history of unilateral ACL reconstruction via HTG (mean+/-standard deviation (SD) age: 28.0+/-7.6years; height: 178.4+/-6.7cm; mass 76.9+/-14.9kg) were included. International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 Subjective Knee Form (IKDC), Lysholm, Knee Osteoarthritis Outcomes Scores (KOOS) and Tampa scores were used to evaluate self-reported outcomes. Concentric and eccentric knee extensor and flexor, and hip strength, postural control and single leg hop distance were evaluated for performance-based outcomes. The relationships between the LSI scores and the performance measures were explored using the Pearson correlation coefficient., RESULTS: The IKDC, Lysholm and KOOS scores were positively correlated with knee extensor and flexor strength LSIs (P<0.05, r=0.34 to r=0.50), and the Tampa score was negatively correlated with eccentric extensor LSI (P=0.02, r=-0.34). Single-leg hop distance LSI was correlated with IKDC and Lysholm scores (P=0.003, r=0.50; P=0.04, r=0.29) respectively, while postural control was only correlated with the KOOS scores (P<0.001, r=0.51 to r=0.52)., CONCLUSIONS: Compared to Lysholm and Tampa scores, KOOS and IKDC scores were more likely to be correlated with performance-based outcomes. Therefore, KOOS and IKDC scores may help clinicians in return to sport decision making when there is a limited time to perform extensive evaluations or access equipment.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the effect of body mass index (BMI) levels on quadriceps and hamstring strength and functional outcomes up to 6 months after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with hamstring tendon autograft (HTG). DESIGN: Prospective, controlled study. SETTING: University clinical laboratory. PATIENTS: Ninety-one participants who had undergone unilateral ACLR with HTG were divided into 2 groups according to their BMI. The participants whose BMI were between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m were included in group 1 (n = 50, age: 27.2 +/- 6.7 years, BMI: 22.3 +/- 1.6 kg/m) and those whose BMI > 24.9 kg/m were included in group 2 (n = 41, age: 30.2 +/- 6.9 years, BMI: 28.0 +/- 2.4 kg/m). INTERVENTIONS: Quadriceps and hamstring strength, functional performance including hop, jump, and balance performance, and IKDC score. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maximum voluntary isometric contraction of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles and the body mass were measured at 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery. Absolute peak torques and normalized peak torques to body weight for both limbs were recorded. Functional outcomes were evaluated at 6 months after surgery. RESULT(S): Normalized quadriceps strength improvement was lower in group 2 when compared with group 1 (F(2,178) = 6.23, P = 0.003). Group 2 also demonstrated lower scores in functional performance (P < 0.05). Normalized hamstring and absolute quadriceps and hamstring strength improvement was not affected by higher BMI level (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION(S): Higher BMI levels adversely affect quadriceps strength capacity and performance in patients who have undergone ACLR with HTG. Clinicians should consider BMI levels of patients when assessing and targeting muscle recovery because it could negatively affect the success of the ACLR rehabilitation.

Purpose: To characterise patients who returned to knee-strenuous sports after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.Methods: Data from isotonic tests of muscle function and patient-reported outcome measures, Tegner activity scale (Tegner and Lysholm in Clin Orthop Relat Res 198:43-49, 1985), physical activity scale, knee injury and osteoarthritis scale and knee self-efficacy scale were extracted from a registry. The 157 included patients, 15-30 years of age, had undergone primary ACL reconstruction and were all involved in knee-strenuous sports, i.e. pre-injury Tegner of 6 or higher. Return to sport was studied in two different ways: return to pre-injury Tegner and return to knee-strenuous sport (Tegner 6).Results: Fifty-two patients (33 %), who returned to pre-injury Tegner, 10 months after surgery, were characterised by better subjective knee function measured with the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (p < 0.05), compared with patients who did not. These patients also had higher perceived self-efficacy of knee function (p < 0.01), measured with knee self-efficacy scale. Eighty-four patients (54 %) who returned to knee-strenuous sports, i.e. Tegner 6 or higher, were characterised by higher goals for physical activity (p < 0.01) and higher self-efficacy of future knee function (p < 0.05). Strength measurements showed that women who returned to sports were stronger in leg extension than women who did not. No differences were found in Limb Symmetry Index for knee strength or jumping ability.Conclusion: Patients who returned to sports after ACL reconstruction had better subjective knee function and higher self-efficacy of knee function. Results highlight that further emphasis should be placed at psychological factors during rehabilitation of patients after ACLR.Level Of Evidence: II.

Purpose: To compare the results of bone-patellar tendon-bone graft (BPTB), semitendinosus-gracilis graft with preserved insertions (STGPI) and semitendinosus-gracilis-free graft (STGF) in terms of graft failure, objective mechanical stability, functional outcome, and return to sports in elite and recreational sports persons. It was hypothesized that the STGPI graft provided superior outcome as compared to the other two grafts.Methods: Two hundred and forty-nine elite and recreational players who underwent ACL reconstruction surgery, with BPTB graft (N = 80), STGPI graft (N = 85), and STGF graft (N = 84) with a minimum follow-up of 2 years, were assessed using clinical tests, knee arthrometer (KT 1000™), single-leg hop test, Lysholm knee score, Tegner's activity scale, and return to sports. Groups were matched in terms of age, gender, mode of injury, side involved, the level of sports, associated injuries, and mean follow-up.Results: The median age of the patients was 24 years (range 16-46 years), with 227 males and 22 females, with a mean follow-up of 61.8 ± 25.9 months. At the final follow-up, the mean side-to-side difference by KT 1000™ was significantly superior in BPTB group (1.4 ± 2.1 mm) as compared to STGPI (1.9 ± 2.0 mm) and STGF group (2.5 ± 2.0 mm) (p = 0.002). The mean Lysholm knee score, Limb symmetry index (LSI) using single-leg hop test and the mean difference in pre-injury and post-surgery level of Tegner's activity scale were not significantly different. The rate of graft failure was significantly higher in STGF group (7.1%) as compared to BPTB (1.2%) and STGPI (1.2%) groups (p = 0.043).Conclusion: BPTB graft is a better graft in terms of mechanical stability than STGPI and STGF grafts. STGPI graft and BPTB graft are superior to STGF graft in terms of graft failure rate. However, there is no statistically significant difference amongst the three grafts in terms of return to sports and clinical tests of instability. STGPI graft is another option in the clinical setting with low graft failure rate like that of BPTB graft and with the added advantage of not having significant donor site morbidity.Level Of Evidence: III.

Purpose: To compare the active joint position sense (JPS), muscle strength, and knee functions in individuals who had anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with quadriceps tendon autograft, hamstring tendon autograft, tibialis anterior allograft and healthy individuals. It was hypothesized that when compared to an age and gender-matched healthy control group, subjects who were post-ACL reconstruction would display impaired active joint position sense, knee extensor and flexor strength symmetry and knee function at 1 year post-surgery. A secondary hypothesis was that differences would exist between the quadriceps tendon autograft, hamstring tendon autograft and tibialis anterior allograft groups.Methods: Sixty-seven patients with ACL reconstruction and 20 healthy individuals were included. Active JPS reproduction was measured at 15°, 45° and 75° of knee flexion. International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score and one-leg hop test were used to assess the functional status of the patients.Results: The JPS detection was different at the 15° target angle between groups (F3.86 = 24.56, p < 0.001). A significantly higher proportion of quadriceps tendon autograft group patients failed to identify the 15° active JPS assessment position compared to the other groups (p < 0.0001). The quadriceps index was lower in patients compared to healthy individuals (p < 0.001), while the hamstring index was similar (n.s.). The knee functional outcomes were similar between ACL reconstructed groups and healthy controls (n.s.).Conclusion: Knee proprioception deficits and impaired muscle strength were evident among patients at a mean 13.5 months post-ACL reconstruction compared with healthy controls. Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using a quadriceps tendon autograft may be more likely to actively over-estimate knee position near terminal extension. Physiotherapists may need to focus greater attention on terminal knee extension proprioceptive awareness among this patient group.Level Of Evidence: III.

BACKGROUND: In people with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, high self‐efficacy facilitates recovery, indicated by improved muscle function, reduced knee symptoms and increased physical activity. Impact of treatment on future self‐efficacy is however not well investigated. The aims of the study were to 1) investigate knee‐related self‐efficacy 6 years after acute ACL injury in patients treated with exercise therapy alone or in combination with either early or the option of delayed ACL reconstruction (ACLR), and 2) to investigate associations between single‐leg physical performance at various time points after ACL injury and knee self‐efficacy at 6 years after injury. METHODS: Participants (n = 121) originated from the KANON‐study (ISRCTN84752559), a treatment RCT including active adults with acute ACL injury treated with structured exercise therapy combined with early or the option of delayed ACLR. In this ancillary study, participants with knee self‐efficacy data at 6 years (n = 89) were analyzed as treated; exercise therapy alone (n = 20), exercise therapy plus early ACLR (n = 46), and exercise therapy plus delayed ACLR (n = 23). The participants performed physical performance tests (hop, strength and balance) at the end the of exercise therapy (mean 10 (SD 6) months), and at 5 years, and rated their knee self‐efficacy using Knee Self‐Efficacy Scale (K‐SES) questionnaire (0 to 10, worst to best) at 6 years. RESULTS: Median K‐SES score for the total group (n = 89) was 7.8 (IQR 5.9‐9.0). There were no differences between treatment groups in K‐SES scores at 6 years nor in physical performance at any time point (p ≥ 0.097). Worse knee flexion strength LSI (rsp = 0.341, p = 0.042) at the end of the exercise therapy, and worse LSI for single‐leg hop test (rsp = 0.310, p = 0.005) at the end of the exercise therapy and at 5 years, correlated moderately with worse knee‐related self‐efficacy at 6 years. Low associations were observed between the remaining physical performance tests and K‐SES scores (rsp ≤ 0.265, p ≥ 0.045). CONCLUSION: Knee‐related self‐efficacy at 6 years after ACL injury did not differ between those treated with ACLR, performed early or as a delayed procedure, or exercise therapy alone. Good physical performance at the end of the exercise therapy, and at 5 years, appears to have a positive, yet small, impact on future knee‐related self‐efficacy.

BACKGROUND: The initial graft tension applied at the time of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction alters joint contact and may influence cartilage health. The objective was to compare outcomes between 2 commonly used "laxity‐based" initial graft tension protocols. HYPOTHESES: (1) The high‐tension group would have less knee laxity, improved clinical and patient‐oriented outcomes, and less cartilage damage than would the low‐tension group after 36 months of healing. (2) The outcomes of the high‐tension group would be equivalent to those of a matched control group. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: Ninety patients with isolated unilateral ACL injuries were randomized to undergo ACL reconstruction using 1 of 2 initial graft tension protocols: (1) autografts tensioned to restore normal anterior‐posterior (AP) laxity at the time of surgery (ie, low tension; n = 46) and (2) autografts tensioned to overconstrain AP laxity by 2 mm (ie, high tension; n = 44). Sixty matched healthy patients formed the control group. Outcomes were assessed preoperatively, intraoperatively, and at 6, 12, and 36 months after surgery. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the 2 initial graft tension protocols for any of the outcome measures at 36 months. However, there were differences when comparing the 2 treatment groups to the control group. On average, AP laxity was 2 mm greater in the ACL‐reconstructed groups than in the control group (P < .007). International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee evaluation scores, peak isokinetic knee extension torques, and 4 of 5 Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOS) were significantly worse than the control group (P < .001, P < .027, and P < .05, respectively). Short Form‐36 Health Survey (SF‐36) scores and reinjury rates were similar between groups at 36 months. Although there were significant changes in radiography and magnetic resonance imaging present in the ACL‐reconstructed knees of both treatment groups, the magnitude was relatively small and likely clinically insignificant at 36 months. CONCLUSION: Both laxity‐based initial graft tension protocols produced similar outcomes without fully restoring joint function or patient‐oriented outcomes (KOOS) when compared with the control group. There was minimal evidence of cartilage damage 36 months after surgery.

Background: Isokinetic strength testing is an important tool in the evaluation of the physical capacities of athletes as well as for decision making regarding return to sports after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in both athletes and the lay population. However, isokinetic testing is time consuming and requires special testing equipment. Hypothesis: A single-jump test, regardless of leg dominance, may provide information regarding knee extension strength through the use of correlation analysis of jump height and peak torque of isokinetic muscle strength. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 169 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were included in this study. Isokinetic testing was performed on the injured and noninjured legs. Additionally, a single-leg countermovement jump was performed to assess jump height using a jump accelerometer sensor. Extension strength values were used to assess the association between isokinetic muscle strength and jump height. Results: The sample consisted of 60 female (mean age, 20.8 ± 8.3 years; mean weight, 61.7 ± 6.5 kg; mean height, 167.7 ± 5.3 cm) and 109 male (mean age, 23.2 ± 7.7 years; mean weight, 74.6 ± 10.2 kg; mean height, 179.9 ± 6.9 cm) patients. Bivariate correlation analysis showed an association (r = 0.56, P < .001) between jump height and isokinetic extension strength on the noninvolved side as well as an association (r = 0.52, P < .001) for the involved side. Regression analysis showed that in addition to jump height (beta = 0.49, P < .001), sex (beta = –0.17, P = .008) and body mass index (beta = 0.37, P < .001) affected isokinetic strength. The final model explained 51.1% of the variance in isokinetic muscle strength, with jump height having the strongest impact (beta = 0.49, P < .001) and explaining 31.5% of the variance. Conclusion: Initial analysis showed a strong association between isokinetic strength and jump height. The study population encompassed various backgrounds, skill levels, and activity profiles, which might have affected the outcome. Even after controlling for age and sex, isokinetic strength was still moderately associated with jump height. Therefore, the jump technique and type of sport should be considered in future research.

Background: Preventing and mitigating the risk of reinjury after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) rest on variables including age, surgical restoration of knee stability, adequate physical function, and thorough and complete postoperative rehabilitation, but to what degree these factors influence return to sport is unclear. Purpose: To investigate factors predictive of return to sport 12 months after ACLR. The factors specifically evaluated were strength, hop function, self-reported knee function, patient age, and quality of postoperative rehabilitation. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: This study evaluated 113 patients approximately 12 months after ACLR using a rehabilitation grading tool, the subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form, and a return-to-sport battery consisting of maximal isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring strength and 4 functional hop tests. Mann-Whitney U tests and chi-square analyses were used to determine differences between patients who had or had not returned to sport. A subsequent binary logistic hierarchical regression determined the factors predictive of a patient’s return to sport. In those patients who had returned to sport, relationships between either age or level of rehabilitation and passing the return-to-sport battery were also investigated. Results: Complete rehabilitation (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 7.95; P = .009), age ≤25 years (adjusted OR, 3.84; P = .024), and higher IKDC scores (P < .001) were predictive of return to sport at 12 months. In participants who had returned to sport, 21% passed the return-to-sport battery compared with only 5% who did not. Of those who had returned to sport, 37% who underwent complete rehabilitation passed the return-to-sport battery as opposed to 5% who underwent incomplete rehabilitation. In patients aged ≤25 years, only 48% underwent complete rehabilitation, despite having returned to sport. Additionally, in this group of patients, 40% underwent complete rehabilitation and passed the physical performance battery as opposed to only 4% who did not undergo complete rehabilitation. Conclusion: Younger patients and higher subjective IKDC scores were predictive of return to sport. Patients who completed 6 months of rehabilitation incorporating jumping and agility tasks had a higher rate of return to sport, suggesting that postoperative rehabilitation is important in predicting return to sport. Specialists and physical therapists alike should stress the importance of thorough postoperative rehabilitation and adequate neuromuscular strength and function to patients whose goals are to return to sport.

Purpose: To investigate strength and functional symmetry during common tests in patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), and its association with post-operative rehabilitation.Methods: At a median 11.0 months post-surgery (range 10-14), 111 ACLR patients were assessed. A rehabilitation grading tool was employed to evaluate the duration and supervision of rehabilitation, as well as whether structured jumping, landing and agility exercises were undertaken. Patients completed the Noyes Activity Score (NSARS), maximal isokinetic knee extensor and flexor strength assessment, and a 4-hop test battery. Limb Symmetry Indices (LSIs) were calculated, presented for the entire group and also stratified by activity level. ANOVA evaluated differences between the operated and unaffected limbs across all tests. Correlations were undertaken to assess the relationship between post-operative rehabilitation and objective test LSIs.Results: The unaffected limb was significantly better (p < 0.0001) than the operated limb for all tests. Only 52-61 patients (47-55%) demonstrated LSIs ≥ 90% for each of the hop tests. Only 34 (30.6%) and 61 (55.0%) patients were ≥ 90% LSI for peak quadriceps and hamstring strength, respectively. Specifically in patients actively participating in jumping, pivoting, cutting, twisting and/or turning sports, 21 patients (36.8%) still demonstrated an LSI < 90% for the single hop for distance, with 37 patients (65.0%) at < 90% for peak knee extension strength. Rehabilitation was significantly associated with the LSIs for all tests.Conclusion: Rehabilitation was significantly correlated with limb symmetry, and lower limb symmetry was below recommended criterion for many community-level ACLR patients, including those already engaging in riskier activities. It is clear that many patients are not undertaking the rehabilitation required to address post-operative strength and functional deficits, and are being cleared to return to sport (or are returning on their own accord) without appropriate evaluation and further guidance.Level Of Evidence: IV.

Background: There are a number of surgical methods for undertaking anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR), although relatively high rates of ipsilateral retears and contralateral tears exist, with only 65% of patients returning to their preinjury level of sport. ACLR techniques adopting synthetic augmentation have been proposed in an attempt to improve clinical outcomes and reduce reinjury rates. Purpose: To determine the efficacy of ACLR using autologous hamstrings augmented with the Ligament Augmentation and Reconstruction System (LARS). Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A total of 65 patients were prospectively treated with arthroscopically assisted single-bundle ACLR using hamstrings augmented with the LARS, of whom 50 were available for 1- and 2-year reviews. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), KT-1000 arthrometer testing, knee range of motion, peak isokinetic knee strength testing, and a battery of 4 hop tests were employed. Limb symmetry indices (LSIs) were calculated. Analysis of variance was used to evaluate differences over time and between limbs. Data on return to the preinjury level of sport, retears, and reoperations were collected. Results: High PROM scores were demonstrated at 1 and 2 years. Before the injury, 47 patients (94%) were actively participating in level 1 or 2 sports, with 38 (76%) and 43 (86%) patients having returned at 1 and 2 years, respectively. Normal (<3 mm; 90%) or nearly normal (3-5 mm; 10%) KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side differences were observed at 2 years. Apart from knee flexion (P <.0001), extension (P =.001), and the 6-m timed hop (P =.039), there were no between-limb differences at 1 year, and there were no differences on any objective measures at 2 years (all P >.05). Mean LSIs across all measures were ≥90%. At 2 years, 84% to 90% of patients were ≥90% on the hop tests, with 72% and 76% of patients having ≥90% for extension and flexion strength, respectively. Two reoperations were undertaken for meniscal tears (7 and 8.5 months), 1 patient (2%) suffered a retear at 7 months, and 2 patients (3%) suffered a contralateral tear (8 and 12 months). Conclusion: This augmented ACLR technique demonstrated good clinical scores, a high rate of return to sport, and low rates of secondary ruptures and contralateral ACL tears at 2 years. Some caution should be noted in interpreting these results, as 15 of 65 patients (23%) were not included in the 2-year follow-up.

We conducted a prospective, randomised controlled trial comparing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using middle third patellar tendon graft (PT) to synthetic Leeds‐Keio (LK) ligament. The patients were randomised (26 PT, 24 LK). Subjective knee function was classified (Lysholm, Tegner activity, IKDC scores), laxity was measured (Lachman test, Stryker laxometer), and functional ability was assessed (one‐hop test). There were no significant differences between Lysholm or IKDC scores at any stage by 5 years. Significant differences were found between the groups at 2 years for Tegner activity scores, laxity and one‐hop testing. By 5 years there were no significant differences. Clinical equivalence was demonstrated between the two groups for the Lysholm score and one‐hop test but not for the Tegner activity score at 5 years. The use of the LK ligament has been largely abandoned due to reports of its insufficiency. Our results demonstrate that it is not as inferior as one might expect. We conclude that the results of LK ligament ACL reconstruction are as acceptable as those using PT. It may provide an additional means of reconstruction where no suitable alternative is present.

Context: Postoperative rehabilitation is critical to optimize outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). However, the relationship between physical therapy (PT) and clinical outcomes is unclear. Objective: To describe PT characteristics following ACLR and to assess the relationships between PT characteristics, surgical procedure, and clinical outcomes. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Laboratory. Patients (or Other Participants): A total of 60 patients (31 females/29 males, age = 22.4 [9.2] y, height = 171.7 [9.9] cm, and mass = 70.2 [14.7] kg) with a history of primary unilateral ACLR (53.6% patellar tendon and 46.4% hamstring) participated. Intervention(s): Patients completed a performance assessment and rated subjective knee function prior to physician clearance (mean = 6.3 [1.3] mo postoperatively) and were contacted within 6 months of clearance to complete a PT questionnaire. Main Outcome Measures: PT questionnaire item response, knee extension maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) torque, peak isokinetic knee extension torque, single leg hop distance, and International Knee Documentation Committee were measured. Correlations assessed relationships between PT quantity and clinical outcomes. Independent t tests compared PT quantity and clinical outcomes based on return-to-sport status, readiness to return to sport, and surgical procedure. Results: Patients completed regular PT (2 d/wk, 25 wk, 58 visits) and were most likely to conclude when discharged by the therapist (68.3%). More than half (56.7%) returned to sport, yet most (73.3%) felt unready at discharge. Isokinetic torque was correlated with days of PT/week (r =.29, P =.03). Isokinetic torque and hop symmetry were reduced in patients who returned to sport (P <.05). Patients who felt ready to return completed fewer weeks of PT (P <.05). Patients with a patellar tendon graft completed more days of PT/week and total visits, but demonstrated lower MVIC torque, MVIC symmetry, and isokinetic symmetry (P <.05). Conclusions: Many patients felt unready to return to sport at PT discharge. PT frequency was associated with isokinetic torque, yet this relationship was small. Outcomes were reduced in patients who returned to sport, suggesting premature resumption of preinjury activity.

Background: Good functional performance with limb symmetry is believed to be important to minimize the risk of injury after a return to pivoting and contact sports after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Purpose: This study aimed to investigate any side-to-side limb differences in functional performance and movement asymmetries in female soccer players with a primary unilateral anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-reconstructed knee and to compare these players with knee-healthy controls from the same soccer teams. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: This study included 77 active female soccer players at a median of 18 months after ACLR (interquartile range [IQR], 14.5 months; range, 7-39 months) and 77 knee-healthy female soccer players. The mean age was 20.1 ± 2.3 years for players with an ACL-reconstructed knee and 19.5 ± 2.2 years for controls. We used a battery of tests to assess postural control (Star Excursion Balance Test) and hop performance (1-legged hop for distance, 5-jump test, and side hop). Movement asymmetries in the lower limbs and trunk were assessed with the drop vertical jump and the tuck jump using 2-dimensional analyses. Results: The reconstructed and uninvolved limbs did not differ in any of the tests. In the 5-jump test, players with an ACL-reconstructed knee performed worse than controls (mean 8.75 ± 1.05 m vs 9.09 ± 0.89 m; P = .034). On the drop vertical jump test, the ACL-reconstructed limb had significantly less knee valgus motion in the frontal plane (median 0.028 m [IQR, 0.049 m] vs 0.045 m [IQR, 0.043 m]; P = .004) and a lower probability of a high knee abduction moment (pKAM) (median 69.2% [IQR, 44.4%] vs 79.8% [IQR, 44.8%]; P = .043) compared with the control players' matched limb (for leg dominance). Results showed that 9% to 49% of players in both groups performed outside recommended guidelines on the different tests. Only 14 players with an ACL-reconstructed knee (18%) and 15 controls (19%) had results that met the recommended guidelines for all 5 tests (P = .837). Conclusion: The reconstructed and uninvolved limbs did not differ, and players with an ACL-reconstructed knee and controls differed only minimally on the functional performance tests, indicating similar function. It is worth noting that many players with an ACL-reconstructed knee and controls had movement asymmetries and a high pKAM pattern, which have previously been associated with an increased risk for both primary and secondary ACL injury in female athletes.

In a two‐centre study, 164 patients with unilateral instability of the anterior cruciate ligament were prospectively randomised to arthroscopic reconstruction with either a patellar tendon graft using interference screw fixation or a quadruple semitendinosus graft using an endobutton fixation technique. The same postoperative rehabilitation protocol was used for all patients and follow‐up at a median of 31 months (24 to 59) was carried out by independent observers. Four patients (2%) were lost to follow‐up. No significant differences were found between the groups regarding the Stryker laxity test, one‐leg hop test, Tegner activity level, Lysholm score, patellofemoral pain score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score or visual analogue scale, reflecting patient satisfaction and knee function. Slightly decreased extension, compared with the non‐operated side, was found in the patellar tendon group (p < 0.05). Patients with associated meniscal injuries had lower IKDC, visual analogue (p < 0.01) and Lysholm scores (p < 0.05) than those without such injuries. Patients in whom reconstruction had been carried out less than five months after the injury had better final IKDC scores than the more chronic cases (p < 0.05). We conclude that patellar tendon and quadruple semitendinous tendon grafts have similar outcomes in the medium term. Associated meniscal pathology significantly affects the final outcome and early reconstruction seems to be beneficial.

BACKGROUND: The additional effect of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction on muscle strength and physical performance after a structured exercise programme is not well understood. OBJECTIVES: To investigate and compare muscle strength and physical performance test results after a structured exercise programme, in young active adults with acute ACL injury, between those treated with and without ACL reconstruction (ACLR) and to evaluate these test results as predictors of clinical outcomes 2 and 5 years after injury. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: In a treatment randomised controlled trial of acute ACL injury (the KANON‐study), 87/121 young active adults underwent two muscle strength tests and five physical performance tests after a structured exercise programme (median 37 (IQR 24) weeks after injury). Results were presented and compared as limb symmetry indices (LSI); endpoints in predictive analyses were having a delayed ACLR over the first 5 years and self‐reported knee function (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score; KOOS4) at 2 and 5 years. RESULTS: Overall, 74‐95% of patients had LSI≥90% in the individual tests, with no difference between treatment groups (p=0.08‐0.92). Results of the one‐leg rise tests predicted KOOS₄ at 2 and 5 years (R²=0.25 and 0.24, p=0.001 and 0.002) and vertical hop results predicted having a delayed ACLR over a 5‐year course after injury (p=0.048) in those starting with exercise alone (n=21). CONCLUSIONS: After an acute ACL tear, the majority of young active adults regain physical performance and muscle strength after a structured exercise programme, with or without surgical reconstruction. Poor physical performance at the end of rehabilitation predicted worse patient‐reported outcomes at 2 and 5 years regardless of treatment. REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN84752559.

Purpose: The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to provide descriptive data on functional performance in men and women with ACLR, to compare bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) with semitendinosus/gracilis (STG) within the same sex and to compare the ACLR subjects with healthy controls.Methods: Eligible participants comprised 100 men (43 % BPTB) and 84 women (41 % BPTB) after ACLR, of whom 30 men (STG n = 19; BPTB n = 11) and 18 women (STG n = 12; BPTB n = 6) were untraceable/not willing and 15 men (STG n = 9; BPTB n = 6) and 18 women (STG n = 12; BPTB n = 3) were not able to take part in the measurements because of injury. Besides men BPTB (n = 24), men STG (n = 27), women BPTB (n = 23) and women STG (n = 23), healthy men (n = 22) and women (n = 22) participated. Measurements consisted of questionnaires, isokinetic peak torque and endurance tests, a hop test battery and drop jump including video analysis.Results: Only the occurrence of dynamic knee valgus differed between ACLR and healthy subjects.Conclusion: Two to nine years after ACLR, 16 % of athletes could not participate because of a lower extremity injury. In the remaining group, this study showed similar results for males and females with BPTB compared with STG. Also, similar results are found for quantity of movement comparing operated and healthy subjects. For quality of movement, only the occurrence of dynamic knee valgus in landing from a jump is higher in operated subjects compared with healthy controls. This supports the relevance of a focus on quality of movement as part of ACLR rehabilitation programmes and return to sports criteria.Level Of Evidence: III.

Background: Patients who undergo anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) have deficiencies in strength, functional performance, and biomechanical function at return to activity. Patients who have abnormal strength and function after ACLR may be at a greater risk for secondary injury and posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Purpose: To examine quadriceps strength, functional performance, and knee biomechanics in patients who are 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after ACLR. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: We recruited 82 participants (45 female) who underwent ACLR and were cleared to return to activity. Participants were assigned to 1 of 4 groups based on their time from ACLR: 9 months (285.26 ± 8.16 days), 12 months (373.59 ± 8.81 days), 18 months (557.50 ± 11.96 days), and 24 months postoperative (741.05 ± 11.86 days). Quadriceps strength was measured concentrically at 60 deg/s. Functional performance was assessed by measuring maximal hop distances or heights during dynamic hopping/jumping tests (single-leg hop, triple hop, crossover hop, and single-leg vertical hop). Biomechanical function was evaluated during the dynamic hop tests by using peak sagittal plane knee flexion angles recorded during landings. Strength, performance, and biomechanics data were collected for both limbs and reported as symmetry scores ([injured/uninjured] × 100). Self-perceived function was measured using the International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form. Results: Quadriceps strength in the 9-month (77.61 ± 16.73) and 12-month (77.80 ± 13.99) groups was significantly lower (P <.01) compared with the 24-month group (92.40 ± 15.55). Self-perceived function for the 9-month group (79.33 ± 10.40) was significantly lower (P <.01) when compared with 12-month (87.58 ± 10.29), 18-month (89.81 ± 8.36), and 24-month (91.59 ± 5.70) groups. Single-leg hop distance symmetry was significantly lower (P <.01) for the 9-month group (90.01 ± 9.46) when compared with the 18-month (96.24 ± 6.47) and 24-month (96.30 ± 6.46) groups; triple hop symmetry was significantly lower (P <.05) for the 9-month group (90.26 ± 10.03) when compared with the 18-month (96.83 ± 9.60) and 24-month (95.91 ± 6.36) groups; and crossover hop was significantly lower (P <.05) for the 9-month group (88.35 ± 13.53) when compared with the 18-month (95.85 ± 8.63) and 24-month (97.10 ± 4.12) groups. Conclusion: Quadriceps strength, self-perceived function, and functional performance improve 9 to 24 months after ACLR, indicating that recovery is ongoing after return to activity. Return-to-activity criteria after ACLR should objectively account for strength and function.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional, controlled laboratory study. BACKGROUND: Postural control following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) primarily has been investigated during static single-leg balance tasks. Little is known about dynamic postural control deficits post-ACLR. OBJECTIVES: To compare dynamic postural control (bilaterally) in individuals who have undergone ACLR and in healthy controls, and to evaluate the relationship between dynamic postural control and self-reported and objective function. METHODS: Ninety-seven participants (66 male; median age, 28 years) 12 months post-ACLR and 48 healthy controls (20 male; median age, 30 years) underwent balance assessment using a Nintendo Wii Balance Board during a single-leg squat. Center-of-pressure (CoP) path velocity, as well as CoP amplitude and standard deviation, in both mediolateral (ML) and anteroposterior (AP) directions were recorded. Self-reported function was assessed with the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation Form (IKDC), while hop for distance was used to evaluate functional status. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, the ACLR group had greater mean CoP path velocity (16% higher, P = .004), ML range (23%, P<.001), ML SD (28%, P<.001), AP range (14%, P = .009), and AP SD (15%, P = .013), indicating worse dynamic balance post-ACLR. Dynamic balance performance was similar between the ACLR limb and the uninjured contralateral limb. The AP SD was weakly associated with hop performance (β = -.2, P = .046); no balance measures were associated with IKDC score. CONCLUSION: Individuals who have undergone ACLR demonstrate impaired dynamic balance bilaterally when performing a single-leg squat, which may have implications for physical function and future injury risk. Routine dynamic balance assessment may help identify patients who could benefit from targeted neuromuscular training programs to improve objective function and potentially lower reinjury risk.

PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare changes in quadriceps and hamstring strength and single-leg-hop (SLH) test performance over the first 24 postoperative months in patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) or hamstring tendon (HT) autografts and followed either a standard or an accelerated rehabilitation protocol. METHOD(S): A total of 160 patients undergoing ACLR were randomised in four groups depending on the graft that was used and the rehabilitation protocol (40 BPTB/standard rehab, 40 BPTB/accelerated rehab, 40 HT/standard rehab, 40 HT/accelerated rehab). Isokinetic concentric quadriceps and hamstring strength at 90degree/s and the SLH test performance were assessed preoperatively and 4,6,8,12 and 24 months postoperatively. The results were reported as the limb symmetry index (LSI) at the same time point. Linear mixed models were used to compare the groups at the different time points. RESULT(S): An average quadriceps strength LSI of 78.4% was found preoperatively. After ACLR, the LSI first decreased at 4 months and then increased from 6 to 24 months, reaching an overall value of 92.7% at the latest follow-up. The BPTB group showed a significantly decreased LSI at 4, 6, 8 and 12 months compared with the HT group. No significant differences between the graft groups were found at 24 months. An average hamstring strength LSI of 84.6% was found preoperatively. After ACLR, the LSI increased from 4 to 24 months in the BTPB group. In the HT group, the LSI first decreased at 4 months and then increased from 6 to 24 months. An LSI of 97.1% and 89.1% was found at the latest follow-up for the BPTB and the HT group, respectively. The HT group showed a significantly decreased LSI at all follow-ups compared with the BPTB group. An average SLH test LSI of 81% was found preoperatively. After ACLR, the LSI increased from 4 to 24 months, reaching 97.6% overall at the latest follow-up. The BPTB group showed a significantly decreased LSI only at 4 months postoperatively compared with the HT group. No significant differences in any of the three tests were found between the standard and accelerated rehabilitation groups for either of the graft groups at any time point. CONCLUSION(S): Muscle strength and SLH test performance recovered progressively after ACLR overall, but they did not all fully recover, as the injured leg performed on average less than 100% compared with the uninjured leg even 24 months postoperatively. After ACLR, inferior quadriceps strength and a poorer SLH test performance were found at 4, 6, 8 and 12 months and at 4 months, respectively, for the BTPB group compared with the HT group. Persistent, inferior hamstring strength was found at all postoperative follow-ups in the HT group. Rehabilitation, standard or accelerated, had no significant impact on the recovery of muscle strength and SLH test performance after ACLR in any of the graft groups.Level I.

Purpose: To assess the percentage of patients achieving symmetrical knee function 6 months after primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) and to identify factors affecting its achievement, in a large cohort.Methods: Data were extracted from our clinic database. Patients who underwent primary ACLR from 2000 to 2015 and were assessed with the isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring muscles strength tests and single-leg-hop test at the 6-month follow-up were included in the study. Demographic data, information on the graft used, cartilage injuries and concomitant meniscal surgery were reviewed. Patients who reached a limb symmetry index (LSI) of ≥ 90% in all three tests were considered to have achieved symmetrical knee function. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine whether patient age, gender, time from injury to surgery, pre-injury Tegner activity level, graft type, cartilage injury and the presence of medial meniscus (MM) or lateral meniscus (LM) resection or repair were factors associated with the achievement of symmetrical knee function 6 months after primary ACLR.Results: A total of 4093 patients (54.3% males) with a mean age of 28.3 ± 10.7 years were included. Data from all three tests were available for 3541 patients. The proportion of patients that achieved a LSI of ≥ 90% was 35.7%, 47.3% and 67.9% for isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength, hamstring muscles strength and the single-leg-hop test, respectively. A total of 693 patients (19.6%) achieved symmetrical knee function, reaching a LSI of ≥ 90% in all three tests. Older age (≥ 30 years) (OR, 0.50; 95% CI 0.41-0.61; P < 0.001), MM resection (OR, 0.75; 95% CI 0.57-0.98; P = 0.03) and MM repair (OR, 0.63; 95% CI 0.40-0.98; P = 0.04) reduced the odds, whereas the use of hamstring tendon (HT) autograft (OR, 2.28; 95% CI 1.51-3.45; P < 0.001) over bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft increased the odds of achieving symmetrical knee function.Conclusion: Only 19.6% of the patients achieved symmetrical knee function 6 months after primary ACLR. Age ≥ 30 years, MM resection and MM repair reduced the chance, whereas the use of HT autograft over BPTB autograft increased the chance of achieving symmetrical knee function 6 months after primary ACLR. This study shows that most of the patients are yet to regain symmetrical knee function 6 months after primary ACLR and, moreover, it identifies several factors affecting its achievement in a large cohort. The results of this study should be used to counsel patients about their expected functional recovery and to optimize rehabilitation and maximize knee function after ACLR.Level Of Evidence: III.

Anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL) reconstruction ( ACLR) surgeries successfully restore anterior tibial translation but not tibial rotation. This study aimed to explore landing strategies focusing on the control of tibial rotation at landing when the ACL is most vulnerable. Three groups of male subjects (50 ACLRs, 26 basketball players, and 31 controls) participated in one-leg forward hop tests for determining the tibial rotatory landing strategies adopted during the initial landing phase. The differences in knee kinematics and muscle activities between internal and external tibial rotatory ( ITR, ETR) landing strategies were examined. A higher proportion of basketball players (34.6%) were found to adopt ITR strategies (controls: 6.5%), exhibiting significantly greater hopping distance and knee strength. After adjusting for hopping distance, subjects adopting ITR strategies were found to hop faster with straighter knees at foot contact and with greater ITR and less knee adduction angular displacement during the initial landing phase. However, significantly greater angular displacement in knee flexion, greater medial hamstring activities, and greater co-contraction index of hamstrings and medial knee muscles were also found during initial landing. Our results support the importance of the recruitments of medial hamstrings or the local co-contraction in assisting the rotatory control of the knee during initial landing for avoiding ACL injuries.

Background: Patient-reported outcomes and return-to-play (RTP) rates are inferior after revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) compared with primary ACLR. Physical properties such as maximal, explosive, and reactive strength influence reinjury and RTP rates after ACLR. No study has compared these outcomes between revision and primary ACLR. Purpose: To compare maximal, explosive, and reactive strength of the ACLR limb, as well as patient-reported outcomes and RTP rates between primary and revision ACLR at 9 months after surgery. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A comparative study was performed at 9 months after surgery for 344 male athletes who had undergone ACLR (298 primary, 46 revision). Maximal strength of the ACLR limb was measured by means of isokinetic dynamometry. Explosive strength was measured by use of single-leg countermovement jump height, and reactive strength was measured by single-leg drop jump. Patient-reported outcomes and responses to RTP questionnaires were recorded for both groups. Results: The primary ACLR group had higher scores than the revision ACLR group for single-leg countermovement jump height (P = .02) and single-leg drop jump reactive strength index (P = .01) on the ACLR limb. No significant difference was observed between groups on maximal strength of the quadriceps or hamstring, and no significant difference in limb symmetry index was observed between groups on any strength or jump test. The primary ACLR group demonstrated higher scores on the Marx Activity Rating Scale (P = .03) and the Anterior Cruciate Ligament--Return to Sport after Injury scale (P < .001). Athletes in the primary ACLR group were more likely to have returned to sport (P < .001). Conclusion: At 9 months after surgery, athletes who had undergone revision ACLR achieved maximal strength similar to that of athletes who had undergone primary ACLR. However, athletes who had revision ACLR demonstrated lower scores on explosive and reactive strength tests. Athletes who underwent revision ACLR had lower RTP rates at 9 months after surgery, potentially due to explosive and reactive strength deficits and lower perceived readiness for RTP.

The purposes of this study were (i) to examine the effects of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) status on hamstring force steadiness, peak hamstring strength, quadriceps (antagonist) activation, and physical performance, and (ii) to evaluate the associations of physical performance with hamstring steadiness and hamstring strength. Thirteen subjects with unilateral deficiency of the ACL (ACLD), 39 matched subjects with unilateral reconstructed ACL (ACLR; n = 25 with bone-patella tendon-bone (ACLR-PT) graft and n = 14 with combined semitendinosus and gracilis tendon (ACLR-STGT) graft) and 33 control subjects participated. Each subject performed maximal-effort isokinetic knee flexion repetitions at 180degree s(-1) with electromyography (EMG) electrodes attached to their medial and lateral quadriceps muscles. Physical performance was assessed using the single-limb long hop for distance. Wavelet-derived mean instantaneous frequency (Mif) of flexor torque-time curves was significantly (p < 0.05) higher (i.e., less smooth) in ACLR-STGT subjects compared to the ACLD, ACLR-PT and control subjects. No significant differences existed for peak hamstrings strength (i.e., peak torque produced) or quadriceps antagonist EMG activity. Positive correlations were identified between hamstrings force steadiness and quadriceps antagonist activity for ACLD (r = 0.797), ACLR-PT (r = 0.467), and ACLR-STGT (r = 0.628) subjects. For ACLR-STGT subjects, reduced hamstrings force steadiness associated with poorer long-hop performance (r = -0.695). Reduced steadiness amongst ACLR-STGT subjects may reflect motor output variability of the antagonist (i.e., quadriceps dyskinesia) and/or agonist musculature-a maladaptive feature which potentially contributes to poorer single-limb hop performance. Measures of hamstring force steadiness in combination with traditional measures of peak hamstring strength provide valuable clinical information regarding knee joint function following ACL injury/ACLR.

Context: Many clinicians measure lower-extremity symmetry after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR); however, testing is completed in a rested state rather than postexercise. Testing postexercise may better model conditions under which injury occurs. Objective: To compare changes in single-leg performance in healthy and individuals with history of ACLR belore and after exercise. Design: Repeated-measures case-control. Setting: Laboratory. Patients: Fifty-two subjects (25 control and 27 ACLR). Intervention: Thirty minutes of exercise. Main Outcome Measures: Limb symmetry and involved limb performance (nondominant for healthy) for single-leg hop, ground contact lime, and jump height during the 4-jump test. Cohen d effect sizes were calculated for all differences identified using a repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: Healthy controls hopped farther than ACLR before (d = 0.65; confidence interval [CI], 0.09 to 1.20) and after exercise (d = 0.60; CI, 0.04 to 1.15). Those with ACLR had longer ground contact time on the reconstructed limb compared with the uninvolved limb after exercise (J = 0.53; CI, -0.02 to 1.09), and the reconstructed limb had greater ground contact time compared with the healthy control limb after exercise (J = 0.38; CI, -0.21 to 0.73). ACLR were less symmetrical than healthy before (d = 0.38; CI, 0.17 to 0.93) and after exercise (d = 0.84; CI, 0.28 to 1.41), and the reconstructed limb demonstrated decreased jump height compared with the healthy control limbs before (d = 0.75; CI, 0.19 to 1.31) and after exercise (d = 0.79; CI, 0.23 to 1.36). Conclusions: ACLR became more symmetric, which may be from adaptations of the reconstructed limb after exercise. Changes in performance and symmetry may provide additional information regarding adaptations to exercise after reconstruction.

Introduction: The effect of leg dominance on anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries has been studied with some studies noting a propensity for injuries in the non-dominant leg. Its effect on post-ACL reconstruction recovery, however, is not well known. The authors hypothesize that dominant limb injuries undergo rehabilitation faster and positively affect early functional outcome scores and return to sports and set about studying these effects.Methods: This is a retrospective study of 254 patients from a single institution who underwent ACL reconstruction for acute ACL ruptures and the results were compared between patients with dominant and non-dominant limb injuries. Objective measurements including the KT-1000, single-leg hop distance and Biodex knee extension peak torque were used to evaluate recovery. Pre- and post-operative functional outcome scores such as the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Tegner activity score and Lysholm knee scale were documented.Results: Early functional outcomes were similar. Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) improvement in IKDC scores was achieved in 69.7% of the dominant versus 66.0% of the non-dominant injury group (p = 0.99), 75.2% versus 79.6% (p = 0.45) for the Lysholm knee scale, and 81.6% versus 84.9% (p = 0.50) for the Tegner activity score. The majority of patients in both subgroups had a return of at least 80% of peak knee flexion and extension peak torque at 5.4 months post-operatively; 92.9% of subjects with a non-dominant leg injury and 87.2% with a dominant leg injury had returned to their pre-injury sports 1 year from surgery.Conclusions: Results from this study suggest that despite theoretical differences, leg dominance does not have a significant impact on short-term functional outcomes and return to sports. Objective measurements suggest that limb strength recovers at a comparable rate. Injuries to either leg demonstrate equally positive improvement post-ACL reconstruction given the same post-operative rehabilitation.Level Of Evidence: III, retrospective comparative study.Level Of Evidence: III, retrospective cohort study.

Background: After anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), relationships between objective measures of muscle function and patient-reported outcomes may change over time. Examining these measures at different time frames after surgery may help develop individualized approaches to improve post-ALCR analysis. Purpose: To examine the associations between subjective knee function and lower-extremity muscle function in individual patients at various time points after ACLR. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Fifty-one participants who underwent primary, unilateral ACLR (15 males, 36 females; mean age, 22.9 ± 4.5 years; mean height, 172.4 ± 10.1 cm; mean weight, 68.7 ± 13.1 kg) were separated into 3 groups depending on time since surgery (early, <2 years; middle, 2-5 years; late, >5 years). Subjective knee function was quantified using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee form and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Isometric knee extension and flexion strength were collected at 90 deg/s. Single-leg hop performance was measured using the single hop, triple hop, crossover hop, and 6-m timed hop. Coefficient correlations were calculated between subjective knee function and objective measures of muscle function for each group. Results: The early group demonstrated moderate correlations between the KOOS and unilateral measures of flexion peak torque (r = 0.514, P = .035) and flexion power (r = 0.54, P = .027). The middle group demonstrated the strongest correlations between the KOOS and symmetry measures of the single hop (r = 0.69, P = .002) and extension work (r = 0.71, P = .002) as well as unilateral measures of the triple hop (r = 0.52, P = .034) and extension work (r = 0.66, P = .004). The late group demonstrated strong correlations between the 6-m timed hop symmetry and the IKDC (r = 0.716, P = .001) and KOOS (r = 0.71, P = .001). Conclusion: Patients with a post-ACLR status of less than 2 years exhibited stronger relationships with unilateral strength measures to subjective function; graft type was found to change these relationships. Patients at 2 to 5 years postsurgery demonstrated relationships with both unilateral and symmetry measures of muscle function to subjective function. Patients who were more than 5 years after ACLR exhibited strong associations between hopping symmetry and subjective function. Clinical Relevance: Future clinical guidelines for patients after ACLR may need to consider time since surgery as a potential factor..

Background:: There is limited information on the appropriate timing of return to sports after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. A composite test was developed to assess the athlete's ability to return to sports after ACL reconstruction: the Knee Santy Athletic Return To Sport (K-STARTS) test.Hypothesis:: The K-STARTS test meets validation criteria for an outcome score assessing readiness for return to sports after ACL reconstruction.Study Design:: Diagnostic study.Level Of Evidence:: Level 3.Methods:: A prospective comparative study identified 410 participants: 371 participants who had undergone ACL reconstruction and a control group of 39 healthy participants. The K-STARTS score is calculated as the sum of 7 tests (8 components), for a maximal value of 21 points. Construct validity, internal consistency, discriminant validity, and sensitivity to change were used to validate this new test.Results:: The K-STARTS assessment showed a high completion rate (100%), high reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.87; coefficient of variation, 7.8%), and high sensitivity to change. There was moderate correlation with the ACL Return to Sports after Injury scale (ACL-RSI) and hop tests. There were no ceiling or floor effects. There was a significant difference between K-STARTS scores assessed at 6 and 8 months postoperatively (11.2 ± 2.7 vs 17.1 ± 3.2; P < 0.001). The K-STARTS score in the control group was significantly higher than that in the ACL reconstruction group (17.3 ± 2.1 and 13.7 ± 3.8, respectively; P < 0.001).Conclusion:: The K-STARTS test is an objective outcome measure for functional improvement after ACL reconstruction.Clinical Relevance:: It is important for the clinician to determine when return to sports is optimal after ACL reconstruction to reduce the current high risk of reinjury.

Background: Outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are not uniformly good and are worse among young female athletes. Developing better rehabilitation and return‐to‐sport training programs and evaluating their outcomes are essential. Purpose: (1) Test the effect of strength, agility, plyometric, and secondary prevention (SAPP) exercises with and without perturbation training (SAPP + PERT) on strength, hops, function, activity levels, and return‐to‐sport rates in young female athletes 1 and 2 years after ACLR and (2) compare 2‐year functional outcomes and activity levels among young female athletes in the Anterior Cruciate Ligament Specialized Post‐Operative Return‐to‐Sports (ACL‐SPORTS) trial to homogeneous cohorts who completed criterion‐based postoperative rehabilitation alone (Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network [MOON]) and in combination with extended preoperative rehabilitation (Delaware‐Oslo). Study Design: Randomized controlled trial, Level of evidence, 1; and cohort study, Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 40 level 1 and level 2 female athletes were enrolled after postoperative impairment resolution 3 to 9 months after primary ACLR. Participants were randomized to 10 SAPP or SAPP + PERT sessions and were tested 1 and 2 years after ACLR on quadriceps strength, hop tests, functional outcomes, and return‐to‐sport rates. Participants were then compared with homogeneous cohorts of young (<25 years) female athletes who completed criterion‐based postoperative rehabilitation alone (MOON) and in combination with extended preoperative rehabilitation (Delaware‐Oslo) on 2‐year functional outcomes. Results: No significant or meaningful differences were found between SAPP and SAPP + PERT, so groups were collapsed for comparison with the other cohorts. At 2‐year follow‐up, ACL‐SPORTS had the highest scores (P <.01) on the Marx activity rating scale (ACL‐SPORTS, 13.5 Â± 3.3; Delaware‐Oslo, 12.5 Â± 2.7; MOON, 10.6 Â± 5.1); International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation Form (96 Â± 7, 92 Â± 9, and 84 Â± 14, respectively); and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subscales for Pain (98 Â± 4, 94 Â± 9, and 90 Â± 10, respectively), Symptoms (94 Â± 6, 90 Â± 9, and 83 Â± 14, respectively), Activities of Daily Living (100 Â± 1, 99 Â± 4, and 96 Â± 7, respectively), Sports and Recreation (94 Â± 8, 86 Â± 15, and 82 Â± 17, respectively), and Quality of Life (89 Â± 14, 78 Â± 18, and 76 Â± 19, respectively). The Patient Acceptable Symptom State threshold on the KOOSâ€“Sports and Recreation was achieved by 100% of the ACL‐SPORTS cohort compared with 90% of Delaware‐Oslo and 78% of MOON (P =.011). Conclusion: Although perturbation training provided no added benefit, 10 sessions of return‐to‐sport training, compared with criterion‐based postoperative rehabilitation alone, yielded statistically significant and clinically meaningfully higher 2‐year functional outcomes among young, high‐level female athletes after ACLR.

Abstract: Background: Functional exercises are important in the rehabilitation of anterior cruciate ligament deficient and reconstructed individuals but movement compensations and incomplete recovery persist. This study aimed to identify how tasks pose different challenges; and evaluate if different activities challenge patient groups differently compared to controls. Methods: Motion and force data were collected during distance hop, squatting and gait for 20 anterior cruciate ligament deficient, 21 reconstructed and 21 controls. Findings: Knee range of motion was greatest during squatting, intermediate during hopping and smallest during gait (P <0.01). Peak internal knee extensor moments were greatest during distance hop (P <0.01). The mean value of peak knee moments was reduced in squatting and gait (P <0.01) compared to hop. Peak internal extensor moments were significantly larger during squatting than gait and peak external adductor moments during gait compared to squatting (P <0.01). Fluency was highest during squatting (P <0.01). All patients demonstrated good recovery of gait but anterior cruciate ligament deficient adopted a strategy of increased fluency (P <0.01). During squatting knee range of motion and peak internal knee extensor moment were reduced in all patients (P <0.01). Both anterior cruciate ligament groups hopped a shorter distance (P <0.01) and had reduced knee range of motion (P <0.025). Anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed had reduced fluency (P <0.01). Interpretation: Distance hop was most challenging; squatting and gait were of similar difficulty but challenged patients in different ways. Despite squatting being an early, less challenging exercise, numerous compensation strategies were identified, indicating that this may be more challenging than gait.

PURPOSE: Quadriceps strength deficits persist for years after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, and patients with these deficits often shift torque demands away from the knee extensors to the hip during functional tasks. However, it is not clear how quadriceps strength deficits may affect hip strength. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate differences in lower extremity strength in individuals with ACL reconstruction with differing levels of quadriceps strength asymmetry. METHODS: Isometric strength was recorded bilaterally in 135 participants (73 control and 62 with unilateral ACL reconstruction, time from surgery = 30.9 ± 17.6 months) from the knee extensors and flexors, hip extensors and abductors, and hip internal and external rotator muscle groups. Symmetry indices (limb symmetry index (LSI)) were created based on quadriceps strength, and subjects with ACL reconstruction were subdivided (high quadriceps (LSI ≥ 90%), n = 37; low quadriceps (LSI < 85%), n = 18). Individual group (control vs high quadriceps vs low quadriceps) by limb (reconstructed/nondominant vs healthy/dominant) repeated‐measures ANOVA was used to compare strength (%BW) for each of the six joint motions of interest (knee extensors/flexors, hip abductors/extensors/external, and internal rotators) while controlling for time from surgery. RESULTS: An interaction was observed for quadriceps strength (P < 0.001), and the reconstructed limb in the low quadriceps group was weaker than all other limbs. A main effect for group was observed with the low quadriceps group having greater hip extension (P = 0.007) strength in both limbs compared with the other groups. Knee flexion strength was weaker in the reconstructed limb of the high quadriceps group (P = 0.047) compared with all other groups and limbs. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with ACL reconstruction and involved limb quadriceps weakness have greater hip extension strength in both limbs compared with patients with bilateral strength symmetry and controls.

BACKGROUND: Athletes often are cleared to return to activities 6 months after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction; however, knee function measures continue to improve up to 2 years after surgery. Interventions beyond standard care may facilitate successful return to preinjury activities and improve functional outcomes. Perturbation training has been used in nonoperative ACL injury and preoperative ACL reconstruction rehabilitation, but has not been examined in postoperative ACL reconstruction rehabilitation, specifically return to sport rehabilitation. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether there were differences at 1 and 2 years after ACL reconstruction between the male SAP (strengthening, agility, and secondary prevention) and SAP+PERT (SAP protocol with the addition of perturbation training) groups with respect to (1) quadriceps strength and single‐legged hop limb symmetry; (2) patient‐reported knee outcome scores; (3) the proportion who achieve self‐reported normal knee function; and (4) the time from surgery to passing return to sport criteria. METHODS: Forty men who had completed ACL reconstruction rehabilitation and met enrollment criteria (3‐9 months after ACL reconstruction, > 80% quadriceps strength limb symmetry, no pain, full ROM, minimal effusion) were randomized into the SAP or SAP+PERT groups of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament‐Specialised Post‐Operative Return to Sports trial (ACL‐SPORTS), a single‐blind randomized clinical study of secondary prevention and return to sport. Quadriceps strength, single‐legged hopping, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 subjective knee form, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)‐sports and recreation, and KOOS‐quality‐of‐life subscales were collected 1 and 2 years after surgery by investigators blind to group. Athletes were categorized as having normal or abnormal knee function at each time point based on IKDC score, and the time until athletes passed strict return‐to‐sport criteria was also recorded. T‐tests, chi square tests, and analyses of variance were used to identify differences between the treatment groups over time. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups for quadriceps symmetry (1 year: SAP = 101% ± 14%, SAP+PERT = 101% ± 14%; 2 years: SAP = 103% ± 11%, SAP+PERT = 98% ± 14%; mean differences between groups at 1 year: 0.4 [‐9.0 to 9.8], 2 years = 4.5 [‐4.3 to 13.1]; mean difference between 1 and 2 years: SAP = ‐1.0 [‐8.6 to 6.6], SAP+PERT = 3.0 [‐4.3 to 10.3], p = 0.45) or single‐legged hop test limb symmetry. There were no clinically meaningful differences for any patient‐reported outcome measures. There was no difference in the proportion of athletes in each group who achieved normal knee function at 1 year (SAP 14 of 19, SAP+PERT 18 of 20, odds ratio 0.31 [0.5‐19.0]; p = 0.18); however, the SAP+PERT group had fewer athletes with normal knee function at 2 years (SAP 17 of 17, SAP+PERT 14 of 19, p = 0.03). There were no differences between groups in the time to pass return to sport criteria (SAP = 325 ± 199 days, SAP+PERT = 233 ± 77 days; mean difference 92 [‐9 to 192], p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: This randomized trial found few differences between an ACL rehabilitation program consisting of strengthening, agility, and secondary prevention and one consisting of those elements as well as perturbation training. In the absence of clinically meaningful differences between groups in knee function and self‐reported outcomes measures, the results indicate that perturbation training may not contribute additional benefit to the strengthening, agility, and secondary prevention base of the ACL‐SPORTS training program. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, therapeutic study.

Background: Anterior cruciate ligament injuries are among the most common knee injuries. Mechanism of injury is classified as contact or non-contact. The majority of anterior cruciate ligament ruptures occur through a non-contact mechanism of injury. Noncontact anterior cruciate ligament ruptures are associated with biomechanical and neuromuscular risk factors that can predispose athletes to injuries and may impact future function. Non-contact mechanism of injury may be preceded by poor dynamic knee stability and therefore those with a non-contact mechanism of injury may be prone to poor dynamic knee stability post-operatively. Understanding how mechanism of injury affects post-operative functional recovery may have clinical implications on rehabilitation. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if mechanism of injury influenced strength, functional performance, patientreported outcome measures, and psychological outlook in athletes at four time points in the first two years following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Study Design: Secondary analysis of a clinical trial. Methods: Seventy-nine athletes underwent functional testing at enrollment after impairment resolution. Quadriceps strength, hop testing, and patient-reported outcome measures were evaluated post-operatively at enrollment, following return-to-sport training and one year and two years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Participants were dichotomized by mechanism of injury (29 contact, 50 noncontact). Independent t-tests were used to compare differences between groups. Results: There were no meaningful differences between contact and non-contact mechanism of injury in any variables at enrollment, post-training, one year, or two years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Conclusion: Function did not differ according to mechanism of injury during late stage rehabilitation or one or two years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Background: An athlete’s desire to return to sport after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is a major indication for ACL reconstruction surgery. Typical clearance to return is 6 to 12 months postoperatively.Purpose: To investigate the return-to-sport rate and participation level of a large cohort at 12 months after ACL reconstruction surgery.Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.Methods: Data were analyzed for 503 patients who participated in competitive-level Australian football, basketball, netball, or soccer after ACL reconstruction surgery using a quadruple-strand hamstring autograft. Inclusion criteria included participation in competitive sport before the ACL injury and clearance from the orthopaedic surgeon to return to sport postoperatively. Patients completed a self-report questionnaire regarding preoperative and postoperative sports participation and the Cincinnati Sports Activity Scale. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee evaluation form and hop tests were used to evaluate knee function.Results: Sixty-seven percent of patients attempted some form of sports activity by 12 months postoperatively; 33% attempted competitive sport. Of those who did not attempt any sports activity by 12 months, 47% indicated that they were planning to return. Men were significantly more likely than women to return. Patients who played sports with a seasonal competition, versus a year-round competition, were significantly more likely to return by 12 months. Patients with normal postoperative knee function (IKDC category A), versus those with nearly normal function (IKDC category B), were no more likely to return, but patients with good hop test results (≥85% limb symmetry index) were more likely to return than patients with poor results (<85%).Conclusion: People may require a longer postoperative rehabilitation period than that typically advocated to facilitate a successful return to competitive sport after ACL reconstruction surgery. The relationship between postoperative knee function and return-to-sport outcomes at 12 months after surgery was inconclusive. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Purpose: The aims of the study were (1) to evaluate the leg asymmetry assessed with ground reaction forces (GRFs) during unilateral and bilateral movements of different knee loads in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructed patients and (2) to investigate differences in leg asymmetry depending on the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Form (IKDC) in order to identify potential compensation strategies.Methods: The knee function of 50 ACL reconstructed (patella tendon) patients was examined at 31 ± 7 months after the surgery. GRFs were quantified during the sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit test, the step-up and step-down test, and the two- and one-leg vertical jump. Further, the IKDC score, the anterior-posterior knee laxity, and the concentric torque of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles were evaluated.Results: Differences between the operated and non-operated leg were found in the knee laxity, the quadriceps torque, and GRFs. The patients with low IKDC scores demonstrated greater leg asymmetries in GRFs compared to the patients with high IKDC scores.Conclusions: ACL reconstructed patients showed GRF asymmetries during unilateral and bilateral movements of different knee loads. Three compensation strategies were found in patients with low subjective knee function: (1) a reduced eccentric load, (2) an inter-limb compensation during bilateral movements, and (3) the avoidance of high vertical impact forces. These compensation strategies may be indicative of a protective adaptation to avoid excessive ACL strain. GRF measurements are practicable and efficient tools to identify individual compensation strategies during early rehabilitation.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed at evaluating and finding the advantages of a program with unexpected disturbances (reaction time beyond 200 ms) in the late rehabilitation (5 months) after ACL‐surgery compared to current sensomotoric based concepts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 50 athletic patients (14 females, 36 males, age: 32.7 ± 10.0 years) were randomized and followed either a new training with the SpeedCourt (28 athletes) or underwent a regular stabilization program (22 athletes). Subjects were assessed at baseline and after 3 weeks, i.e. six sessions in total. The comparison of evaluations (pre‐ and post‐training) was calculated with a two‐factorial (time, group) univariate analysis with parameters for flexibility, reaction time, tapping, jump force (uni‐ and bi‐lateral) and anthropometry. RESULTS: In between the two groups 5 out of 22 parameters (23 %) showed significant influences, i.e. highest in the lower leg dimensions 15 cm below joint‐line of the operated knee joint (η (2) = 0.122), non‐operated knee joint (η (2) = 0.200) and the lower leg dimensions 10 cm below joint‐line of the non‐operated knee joint (η (2) = 0.183). Jump height unilateral and reaction time on the surgically treated leg were also different and improved (η (2) = 0.148; η (2) = 0.138) significantly. Differences in the outcome parameters like tapping, jump height and ground reaction time between the operated and non‐operated knee were remarkably reduced in the SpeedCourt intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: Interventional training programs with the SpeedCourt system seem to be advantageous in the late rehabilitation following ACL‐knee surgery compared to current sensomotoric based concepts. We achieved improvements of anthropometric and functional parameters. Further studies with larger groups and longer periods of evaluation are necessary to support these data and to possibly establish a new innovative rehabilitation concept. Clinically, the demonstrated SpeedCourt system might help to determine the time "back/return to sports" for athletes more objectively and prospectively reduce the rate of ACL re‐injuries.

Background: The use of a quadriceps tendon-patellar bone (QTPB) autograft provides an alternative procedure in primary reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Using the press-fit technique for femoral fixation and knotting over a bone bridge as well as additional spongiosa filling for tibial fixation can completely eliminate the need for fixation implants. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical, functional and radiological results of this operating method.Methods: Sixty-nine patients (27 female-42 male) were included in this study. Fifty-seven patients (83%) received a comprehensive follow-up review after an average period of 7.5 years (range: 7-8.7). All other patients were surveyed by telephone. Six patients (9%) suffered a re-rupture of the ACL graft caused by a new related trauma and were therefore excluded from the statistical analysis.Results: Of all patients, 98% were satisfied with the operation. Normal or almost normal results were recorded in the subjective IKDC scores form by 88% of the patients. The Lysholm score demonstrated very good and good results in 83% of the patients. Only 1 patient reported minor complaints in the donor area. Seven (12%) patients developed Cyclops syndrome with limited knee extension. This complication was treated arthroscopically within the first year postoperatively. Their results on follow-up were not worse than the results of the patients without Cyclops syndrome. Regarding the 57 patients who received a comprehensive evaluation, the stability test with the KT-1000 Arthrometer yielded a difference of less than 3 mm in the contralateral comparison for 89% of the operated knees. The pivot-shift test was normal in 79% and almost normal in 21%. In the Single-leg Triple Hop Test, patients achieved an average of 98% of the hopping distance attained with the contralateral leg. The radiological examination revealed a slight deterioration in the Kellgren-Lawrence Score in 2 patients.Conclusion: The ACL reconstruction using the QTPB autograft performed with the press-fit technique leads to good results in comparison with published results of established procedures for primary ACL surgery using other autografts. Further investigations should involve comparative studies with the objective of providing evidence-based, individually adapted therapy for ACL rupture.

BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials after anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions with long‐term follow‐up including assessment of health‐related quality of life are rare. PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcome and health‐related quality of life 8 years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using 2 types of graft. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: Long‐term follow‐up of 164 patients with anterior cruciate ligament injury randomized to arthroscopic reconstruction with a quadrupled semitendinosus graft or a bone‐patellar tendon‐bone graft was undertaken. After a mean 8 years, 153 patients were available for follow‐up, including instrumented laxity, 1‐legged hop test, a knee‐walking test, and assessment with International Knee Documentation Committee, Lysholm, Tegner, and patellofemoral pain score. Health‐related quality of life was assessed with Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and Short Form‐36. RESULTS: Patients in both graft groups retained the same stability, knee function, and health‐related quality of life. The patellofemoral pain score was similar for both groups; the bone‐patellar tendon‐bone group had more donor site morbidity from kneeling and knee walking. In the bone‐patellar tendon‐bone group, 19 patients had no kneeling problems, 23 slight problems, 31 moderate problems, and 5 unable to kneel. Corresponding figures for the semitendinosus group were 25, 32, 16, and 2 (P < .001). Patients with early reconstructions (<5 months) had a lower risk for meniscal injuries (37%) than did later reconstructed (62%, P = .008). Health‐related quality of life regarding physical functioning in Short Form‐36 was better for the early‐reconstructed patients than for the later reconstructed (92 vs 85; P = .014). Patients without medial meniscal surgery had higher Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores for all subscales than did patients with medial meniscal surgery, with most significant difference for sport and recreation (63 vs 75, P = .008). CONCLUSION: In the long term, the semitendinosus graft provided similar stability, knee function, and health‐related quality of life but with less kneeling morbidity than did the bone‐patellar tendon‐bone graft.

Background: The objective of the study was to compare the results of a primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using the press-fit fixation technique for a quadriceps tendon (QT) graft to a standard quadrupled hamstring (HT) graft with interference screw fixation.Methods: A retrospective cohort study with a 12-month follow up provided data for 92 patients. Exclusion criteria were accompanying ligament injuries and contralateral ACL injury. Patients who suffered a graft failure, which was defined as a side-to-side difference of > 3 mm, or infection were rated 'D' according to the IKDC and excluded from further evaluation. Forty-six patients underwent primary ACLR using the press-fit fixation technique for autologous bone QT graft. These patients were matched in terms of age, gender, accompanying meniscus tear and cartilage injury to 46 patients who underwent standard HT graft with interference screw fixation. Patients were evaluated according to the Lachman test, Pivot-Shift test, IKDC score, Tegner score, Rolimeter measurements, one-leg hop test, thigh circumference and donor side morbidity.Results: No significant differences in Tegner score (p = 0.9), subjective or objective IKDC score (p = 0.9;p = 0.6), knee stability (Lachman Test p = 0.6; Pivot-Shift Test p = 0.4; Side-to-Side Difference p = 0.4), functioning testing (One-Leg Hop Test p = 0.6; Thigh Circumference p = 0.4) or donor side morbidity (p = 0.4) were observed at the follow up. The Lachman test was negative for 85% of the QT group and 83% of the HT group. The Pivot Shift Test was negative for 80% of the QT group and 85% of the HT group. The mean side-to-side difference was 1.6 ± 0 .2mm in both groups. The one-leg hop test revealed a collateral-side jumping distance of 96.2 ± 8.5% for the QT group and 95.5 ± 8.5% for the HT group. The thigh circumference of the injured leg was 98.3 ± 3.0% on the uninjured side in the QT group and 99.7 ± 3.0% in the HT group. A knee walking test resulted in no discomfort for 90% of the QT group and 85% of the HT group. The graft failure rate was 7.3% in the QT group and 9.8% in the HT group.Conclusion: QT grafts fixated using the press-fit technique are a reliable alternative for primary ACL surgery.

BACKGROUND: The "initial graft tension" applied at the time of graft fixation during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery modulates joint contact mechanics, which in turn may promote posttraumatic osteoarthritis (OA). PURPOSE/HYPOTHESES: The study objectives were to compare clinical, functional, patient‐reported, and OA imaging outcomes between 2 different initial laxity‐based graft tension cohorts and a matched uninjured control group as well as to evaluate the effects of laxity‐based graft tension on OA development at 84‐month follow‐up. The 2 laxity‐based tension protocols were (1) to restore normal anteroposterior (AP) laxity at the time of surgery relative to the contralateral uninjured knee (low‐tension group) or (2) to overconstrain AP laxity by 2 mm relative to the contralateral uninjured knee (high‐tension group). The hypotheses were that (1) the high‐tension group would have improved outcomes and decreased OA compared with the low‐tension group after 84 months, and (2) the outcomes for the high‐tension group would be equivalent to those for an age‐, sex‐, race‐, and activity‐matched group of control participants with uninjured knees. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: Patients had their ACLs reconstructed with either a bone‐patellar tendon‐bone or 4‐stranded hamstring autograft, and outcomes were compared with a matched control group. Outcomes were evaluated preoperatively and at 60 and 84 months postoperatively and included clinical (KT‐1000 arthrometer AP laxity measurement and International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] examination score), functional (1‐legged hop for distance and knee extensor torque), patient‐reported (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS], Short Form‐36 [SF‐36], and patient satisfaction survey), and OA imaging (measurement of joint space width [JSW], Osteoarthritis Research Society International [OARSI] radiographic score, and Whole‐Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score [WORMS]) components. Repeated‐measures analyses of variance were used to evaluate differences in outcomes between the treatment groups and the control group. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the 2 tension groups in 1 of 5 KOOS subscales (sports and recreation; P = .04) and 2 of 8 SF‐36 subscales (vitality, mental health; P < .04) at 84 and 60 months, respectively. Both tension groups scored significantly worse than the control group in the IKDC examination (P < .001), 1‐legged hop (P ≤ .017), KOOS quality of life and symptoms subscales (P < .03), and OARSI radiographic score (P ≤ .02) at 84 months. The low‐tension group performed significantly worse than the control group on the KOOS pain subscale (P = .03), SF‐36 general health and social functioning (P < .04), OARSI radiographic score (P < .001), and WORMS (P = .001), while the high‐tension group had statistically different results than the control group in AP knee laxity (P < .001), radiographic JSW (P = .003), and OARSI radiographic score (P = .02) as well as significantly more subsequent knee injuries (P = .02) at 84 months. CONCLUSION: The results do not support the hypotheses that the high‐tension group would have improved outcomes when compared with the low‐tension group after 84 months of healing or that the outcomes for the high‐tension group would be equivalent to those for the matched control group. While there were minor differences in patient‐reported outcomes between the 2 laxity‐based tension groups, all other outcomes were similar. REGISTRATION: NCT00434837.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to compare the results after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using either the double‐bundle or single‐bundle technique with hamstring tendon autografts in an unselected group of patients. HYPOTHESIS: Double‐bundle ACL reconstruction will render a better outcome on the pivot‐shift test. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: A randomized series of 103 patients (33 women, 70 men; median age, 27 years; range, 18‐52 years) with a unilateral ACL rupture underwent anatomic ACL reconstruction. The double‐bundle technique was used in 53 patients, and the single‐bundle technique was used in 50 patients. The ACL footprint was visualized, and the femoral tunnel was drilled through the anteromedial portal; interference screw fixation was used at both ends. The patients were examined preoperatively and at a median of 26 months (range, 22‐42 months) after the reconstruction by a blinded observer. The primary variable was the pivot‐shift test. RESULTS: At 2‐year follow‐up, 98 patients (93%) were examined. Clinical assessments at follow‐up revealed no significant differences between the double‐bundle and single‐bundle groups in terms of the pivot‐shift test, KT‐1000 arthrometer laxity measurements, manual Lachman test, range of motion, Lysholm knee scoring scale, Tegner activity scale, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis and Outcome Score (KOOS), 1‐legged hop test, and square hop test. A significant improvement was seen in both groups compared with the preoperative values in terms of most clinical assessments. CONCLUSION: In this prospective randomized study, the primary variable, the pivot‐shift test, and other subjective and objective outcome variables revealed no significant differences between the double‐bundle and single‐bundle techniques at 2 years after ACL reconstruction in an unselected group of patients.

PURPOSE: The hypothesis of this study was that single-legged horizontal hop test ratios would correlate with IKDC, KOOS, and Marx activity level scores in patients 2 years after primary ACL reconstruction., METHODS: Individual patient-reported outcome tools and hop test ratios on 69 ACL reconstructed patients were compared using correlations and multivariable modeling. Correlations between specific questions on the IKDC and KOOS concerning the ability to jump and hop ratios were also performed., RESULTS: The triple-hop ratio was moderately but significantly correlated with the IKDC, KOOS Sports and Recreation subscale, and the KOOS Knee Related Quality of Life subscale, as well as with the specific questions related to jumping. Similar but weaker relationship patterns were found for the single-hop ratio and timed hop. No significant correlations were found for the Marx activity level or crossover-hop ratio. Multivariable modeling showed almost no significant additional contribution to predictability of the IKDC or KOOS subscores by gender, BMI, or the number of faults on either leg., CONCLUSIONS: The triple-hop test is most significantly correlated with patient-reported outcome scores. Multivariable modeling indicates that less than a quarter of the variability in outcome scores can be explained by hop test results. This indicates that neither test can serve as a direct proxy for the other; however, assessment of patient physical function by either direct report using validated outcome tools or by the hop test will provide relatively comparable data.

Background: For the patient returning to sport after injury, physical and psychological aptitude are crucial elements: premature return is a risk factor for new injury. The Anterior-Cruciate-Ligament Return-to-Sport-After-Injury (ACL-RSI) scale can be used to quantify the impact of psychological factors affecting a patient's aptitude for return-to-sport. Method(s): A prospective single-center cohort study included a series of athletes who underwent surgical treatment in 2013-2016 for an isolated primary full-thickness ACL tear. These patients had a healthy contralateral knee. A complete clinical work-up with function tests was conducted postoperatively and at six months. Isokinetic tests were performed with Con-Trex JM to measure knee muscle force at three angular speeds: concentric quadriceps contraction at 60degree (Q 60degree) and 240degree (Q 240degree) and excentric hamstring contraction at 30degree (H 30degree). Neuromuscular tests used the single-leg jump. The main outcome was the correlation between ACI-RSI score and inter-knee difference in Q 60degree at six months. Result(s): Inclusion criteria were met by 182 patients. Mean follow-up was 6.5 +/- 1.7 months (range: 4-12). The ACL-RSI score was positively and weakly significantly correlated with jump test results (r = 0.15-0.18; P = 0.1-0.03). The ACL-RSI exhibited better significance among patients who had returned to sport (P = 0.0001). Conclusion(s): At six months, the ACL-RSI is significantly and positively correlated with isokinetic and function tests, though weakly.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS

BACKGROUND: The decision to return to sport following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction should not only be based on time since surgery. This study aimed to assess, using isokinetic and neuromuscular (hops) testing in a large group, postoperative objective functional recovery of the knee. The secondary objective was to determine the relationship between psychological, functional scores, and these postoperative tests., METHODS: This prospective study included athletes who underwent surgery between 2013 and 2016 for an isolated full-thickness ACL tear. They received a complete evaluation of functional performance of the knee by isokinetic tests performed on a dynamometer to measure quadriceps and hamstring strength, and neuromuscular assessment based on single-leg hop tests. The main judgment criterion was satisfactory functional recovery (yes/no) defined as a difference of <=10% both in the quadriceps 60degree/s and the single hop at a minimum of four months of follow-up., RESULTS: A total of 234 athletes were analyzed. The mean age was 28.4+/-8.6years. At 6.5+/-1.7months mean follow-up, 44 (18.5%) patients had satisfactory functional recovery of the knee. The correlations between isokinetic/hop tests and the different scores were variable. During follow-up, two patients presented with a graft tear and two with a contralateral ACL tear, all in the group with unsatisfactory functional recovery., CONCLUSION: At a mean of six months after ACL reconstruction, objective functional recovery of the knee was generally unsatisfactory and this seemed to be a risk factor for recurrent tears., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV; case series.

BACKGROUND: Although isokinetic dynamometry often serves as a reference to assess the concurrent validity of weight-machine isotonic strength testing, it is unknown whether isokinetic knee strength is associated with knee function and activity level more strongly than isotonic knee strength in patients with an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). This study aimed to compare the associations of isokinetic and isotonic knee strength with knee function and work-and-sports activity levels in patients with ACLR., METHODS: One-hundred and six patients with a unilateral ACLR participated. At three months post-ACLR, isokinetic quadriceps and hamstrings strength was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer whilst isotonic strength was measured using weight machines. At six months post-ACLR, patients performed the single-leg hop-for-distance test. Self reported knee function and work-and-sports activity levels were assessed by the Lysholm Knee Score and Tegner Activity Score, respectively., RESULTS: In multivariable analyses, isotonic and isokinetic quadriceps strength limb symmetry indices (LSIs) were significantly associated with all outcomes (P<=0.03) and had comparable predictive performance. Isotonic and isokinetic hamstrings strength LSIs were significantly associated with Lysholm scores (P<=0.03) and isotonic hamstrings strength was additionally significantly associated with hop-for-distance LSI (P=0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Weight machine-derived isotonic quadriceps strength was independently and consistently associated with knee function and work-and-sport activity level post-ACLR. Isokinetic knee strength was not more strongly associated than isotonic knee strength with the various outcomes. These findings have logistic and economic implications because the isokinetic dynamometer system is relatively expensive and its operation requires more logistic effort and technical skills.

Purpose: The aim of this study was to (1) describe psychological outcomes during the first year after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and (2) compare psychological outcomes in patients who recover symmetrical muscle function with patients who do not.Methods: The included patients had undergone a unilateral ACL reconstruction. Patients with a re-rupture and contralateral ACL injury were excluded. Three groups, based on the results from 5 tests of muscle function 12 months after reconstruction, were created. Three validated questionnaires (the Knee Self-Efficacy Scale; the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score subscale "Quality of Life"; the ACL Return to Sport after Injury scale) and a single question "Have you achieved your goal with rehabilitation?" were analysed in 4 different follow-ups after ACL reconstruction (10 weeks, 4, 8 and 12 months). Means and standard deviations were analysed with standard t tests and reported with 95% confidence intervals.Results: A total of 328 patients (120 men, 37%), mean age 27.8 ± 10 years, were included. Patients who did not recover symmetrical muscle function (n = 56; 17%) at the 12-month follow-up reported inferior knee-related self-efficacy and quality of life than patients who recovered symmetrical muscle function (n = 96; 29%) at all follow-ups, except quality of life at 4 months. The proportion of patients who stated they achieved their rehabilitation goal at 12 months was 17% for the entire cohort, 24% for patients who recovered muscle function and 5% for patients who did not recover muscle function.Conclusion: Patients who recovered strength and hop symmetry 12 months after ACL reconstruction had superior knee-related self-efficacy and greater quality of life during the whole first year after ACL reconstruction. These results can aid clinicians in the decision-making process by providing knowledge of patients who might need further attention during rehabilitation.Level Of Evidence: III.

Purpose: Hop tests are widely used to quantify recovery from anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) surgery. However, there is evidence that simply measuring hop distance may not be indicative of the quality of movement or representative of potential limitations in hopping mechanics, particularly during landing. The first purpose of the present study was to compare hop distance and loading symmetry between ACLR athletes and healthy uninjured recreational athletes. The second was to determine the association between hop distance and loading symmetry. Methods: Twenty-five ACLR patients and 30 healthy controls completed the single hop, triple hop, and crossover hop test on each limb while the loadsol®, a single-sensor force insole, collected impact forces (100 Hz). A limb symmetry index (LSI) was calculated for hop distance, peak impact force, loading rate, and impulse from the final landing of each trial. LSI values were compared between groups using Mann–Whitney U tests, and distance and loading LSI values were compared using Spearman rank correlations. Results: ACLR patients had reduced symmetry in hop distance and loading relative to healthy controls for every hop test and outcome measure (P < 0.05), except peak impact force on the single hop. Hop distance symmetry was significantly related to each loading symmetry measure on the crossover hop test (P < 0.01) and to peak impact force and impulse symmetry on the single hop test (P < 0.05) in each group. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that ACLR patients both hop further and generate larger forces when hopping on their nonsurgical limb relative to their surgical limb. In addition, hop distance and loading symmetry provide clinicians and researchers with different information and therefore should be considered together when making return to sport decisions.

BACKGROUND: Not meeting functional performance criteria increases reinjury risk after ACL reconstruction (ACLR), but the implications for osteoarthritis are not well known., OBJECTIVE: To determine if poor functional performance post-ACLR is associated with risk of worsening early osteoarthritis features, knee symptoms, function and quality of life (QoL)., METHODS: Seventy-eight participants (48 men) aged 28+/-15 years completed a functional performance test battery (three hop tests, one-leg-rise) 1 year post-ACLR. Poor functional performance was defined as <90% limb symmetry index (LSI) on each test. At 1 and 5 years, MRI, Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective form were completed. Primary outcomes were: (i) worsening patellofemoral and tibiofemoral MRI-osteoarthritis features (cartilage, bone marrow lesions (BMLs) and meniscus) and (ii) change in KOOS and IKDC scores, between 1 and 5 years., RESULTS: Only 14 (18%) passed (>=90% LSI on all tests) the functional test battery. Poor functional performance on the battery (all four tests <90% LSI) 1 year post-ACLR was associated with 3.66 times (95% CI 1.12 to 12.01) greater risk of worsening patellofemoral BMLs. A triple-crossover hop <90% LSI was associated with 2.09 (95% CI 1.15 to 3.81) times greater risk of worsening patellofemoral cartilage. There was generally no association between functional performance and tibiofemoral MRI-osteoarthritis features, or KOOS/IKDC scores., CONCLUSION: Only one in five participants met common functional performance criteria (>=90% LSI all four tests) 1 year post-ACLR. Poor function on all four tests was associated with a 3.66 times increased risk of worsening patellofemoral BMLs, and generally not associated with decline in self-reported outcomes.

Background: Quadriceps strength deficits are observed clinically after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and reconstruction and are often not overcome despite rehabilitation. Given that quadriceps strength may be important for achieving symmetrical joint biomechanics and promoting long-term joint health, determining the magnitude of strength deficits that lead to altered mechanics is critical. Purpose: To determine if the magnitude of quadriceps strength asymmetry alters knee and hip biomechanical symmetry as well as functional performance and self-reported function. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 73 patients were tested at the time they were cleared for return to activity after ACL reconstruction. Quadriceps strength and activation, scores on the International Knee Documentation Committee form, the hop for distance test, and sagittal plane lower extremity biomechanics were recorded while patients completed a single-legged hop. Results: Patients with high and moderate quadriceps strength symmetry had larger central activation ratios as well as greater limb symmetry indices on the hop for distance compared with patients with low quadriceps strength symmetry (P < .05). Similarly, knee flexion angle and external moment symmetry were higher in the patients with high and moderate quadriceps symmetry compared with those with low symmetry (P < .05). Quadriceps strength was found to be associated with sagittal plane knee angle and moment symmetry (P < .05). Conclusion: Patients with low quadriceps strength displayed greater movement asymmetries at the knee in the sagittal plane. Quadriceps strength was related to movement asymmetries and functional performance. Rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction needs to focus on maximizing quadriceps strength, which likely will lead to more symmetrical knee biomechanics.

To investigate whether relationships between kinesiophobia, lower extremity function, and patient-reported function differ by self-reported physical activity engagement after ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Cross-sectional. Laboratory. Seventy-seven patients with a primary, unilateral ACLR. Kinesiophobia (TSK-17) was the primary outcome. Lower extremity function included quadriceps and hamstrings strength, fatigue, and hop performance. Patient-reported function included regional function (IKDC, KOOS subscales) and physical activity engagement (Godin Leisure-Time Exercise). Patients were evaluated together, then stratified by LOW and HIGH physical activity. Correlations and multiple regression analyses identified relationships between kinesiophobia and outcome measures. Greater kinesiophobia was associated with lesser hamstrings strength, hop performance, and patient-reported function. Greater hamstrings fatigue and lesser KOOS ADL explained greater kinesiophobia in patients reporting LOW physical activity. Lesser triple hop symmetry, crossover hop distance, and IKDC explained greater kinesiophobia in patients reporting HIGH physical activity. Greater kinesiophobia associated with worse outcomes after ACLR. Relationships differed by self-reported physical activity engagement. Interventions that improve the ability to perform knee-related activities of daily living may be appropriate to minimize the impact of fear in less active patients, while those targeting hop performance and knee-related sport activities may be better suited for more active patients. • Greater kinesiophobia was associated with worse clinical outcomes after ACLR. • Worse hamstrings fatigue and KOOS ADL explained kinesiophobia (LOW). • Worse triple hop symmetry, crossover hop, and IKDC explained kinesiophobia (HIGH). • Early intervention strategies should consider physical activity engagement after ACLR.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the frequency of passing return-to-activity tests after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and to investigate the influence of patient-specific factors on pass rates. We hypothesized that isolated strength tests would be most difficult to pass and that graft type would be the most influential factor. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty patients with a history of primary, unilateral ACLR, and 80 healthy controls participated. INTERVENTIONS: Bilateral isokinetic strength, isometric strength, and single-leg hop tests were recorded during a single visit. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Evaluation measured subjective knee function, and the Tegner Activity Scale measured physical activity level. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pass rates were calculated for 3 thresholds of absolute between-limb asymmetry: 0% to 10%, 11% to 15%, and 16% to 20%. Pass rates were compared by sex (male and female), graft type (patellar and hamstrings), meniscal procedure (yes and no), physical activity level (= median Tegner), and time from surgery (= 6 months). RESULT(S): Isokinetic quadriceps strength was consistently most difficult to pass, whereas the 6-meter timed hop and crossover hop tests were easiest. Graft type had the greatest influence on pass rates (isometric quadriceps and hamstring strength, hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio), followed by time from surgery (6-meter timed hop and crossover hop), physical activity (IKDC), and meniscal procedure (6-meter timed hop). CONCLUSION(S): Isokinetic quadriceps strength was the most difficult test to pass, and single-leg hop tests were the easiest. Patient-specific factors including graft type, time from surgery, physical activity level, and meniscal procedure may influence the ability to meet return-to-activity criterion after ACLR.

PURPOSE: The purpose was to prospectively compare the outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using bone‐tendon Achilles allograft with those of free tendon Achilles allograft in 2 groups of active young men. METHODS: We enrolled 72 subjects in the study. Of these, 33 subjects who had ACL reconstruction with Achilles allograft with calcaneal bone block on its end (group I) and 34 who had ACL reconstruction with free tendon Achilles allograft (group II) were followed up for a minimum of 2 years. The Lachman test, pivot‐shift test, and 1‐leg hop test were evaluated at the last follow‐up. The International Knee Documentation Committee classification, Lysholm score, and side‐to‐side difference were assessed preoperatively and at the last follow‐up. The Tegner activity scale was evaluated before injury and at the last follow‐up. RESULTS: The mean follow‐up period was 30.9 months (range, 26 to 38 months). At the last follow‐up, there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups for the Lachman test, pivot‐shift test, 1‐leg hop test, International Knee Documentation Committee classification, Lysholm score, and side‐to‐side difference (P > .05). Three subjects in group I and three in group II showed an activity level 2 steps below the preinjury activity level. The rest of the subjects returned to the preinjury activity level or showed a level 1 step below the preinjury activity level. CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes of ACL reconstructions using Achilles allograft between the bone‐tendon group and the free tendon group in active young men. Free tendon Achilles allograft may be considered an option for ACL reconstruction. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, therapeutic study, randomized controlled trial.

PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes of tibial fixation between a biodegradable interference screw only and a biodegradable interference screw supplemented by a post‐tie using a washer screw in single‐bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with 2‐strand free tendon Achilles allograft in active young men. METHODS: A prospective study was performed in 80 subjects who underwent single‐bundle ACL reconstruction. A 2‐strand free tendon Achilles allograft fixed with an EndoButton (Smith & Nephew, Andover, MA) in the femoral tunnel and with a Bio‐Interference screw (Arthrex, Naples, FL) in the tibial tunnel was used in group I. Supplementary fixation was performed with a post‐tie using a washer screw in group II. The Lachman test, pivot‐shift test, International Knee Documentation Committee classification, Lysholm score, range of knee motion, and side‐to‐side difference were evaluated preoperatively and at the last follow‐up. The Tegner activity scale was evaluated before injury and at the last follow‐up. The 1‐leg hop test was assessed at the last follow‐up. RESULTS: Of the patients, 36 in group I and 35 in group II could be followed up for at least 2 years. At the last follow‐up, 7 patients in group I and 1 in group II showed a 2+ or 3+ on the Lachman test (P = .027). The mean side‐to‐side difference was 2.9 ± 2.3 mm in group I and 1.4 ± 1.6 mm in group II at the last follow‐up (P = .002). The other clinical outcomes were not significantly different between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementary tibial fixation with a post‐tie in ACL reconstruction using 2‐strand free tendon Achilles allograft was more effective than a biodegradable interference screw only in restoration of the anterior stability of the tibia. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, randomized controlled trial.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare clinical outcomes after single‐bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with a free Achilles tendon allograft using either a transtibial or an anteromedial portal technique and then to quantify the difference in femoral tunnel position between these 2 approaches. This assessment was to be performed with a new method using conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a digital imaging system. METHODS: In this prospective randomized comparative study, 53 young male patients with ACL rupture underwent ACL reconstruction with the transtibial technique (group 1) or the anteromedial portal technique (group 2). We assessed clinical outcomes with the Lachman test, pivot shift test, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) classification, Lysholm score, Tegner activity scale, and single leg hop (SLH) test. Radiologic assessments included the position of the femoral tunnel aperture and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) index on conventional MRI and the side‐to‐side difference (SSD) on stress radiographs. RESULTS: Sixty‐one participants had follow‐up. The mean follow‐up period was 30.2 months. At the last follow‐up, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in results from the Lachman test, pivot shift test, IKDC classification, Tegner activity scale, and SLH test. The Lysholm score and SSD results in group 2 were superior to those in group 1 (P < .001). The femoral tunnel aperture was positioned more posteriorly in group 2 than in group 1 (P < .001). Changes in the PCL index were greater in group 1 than in group 2 (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The position of the femoral tunnel aperture created with the anteromedial portal technique was more posterior than that made with the transtibial technique. Knees reconstructed with the anteromedial portal technique were more stable in Telos testing, and were 3 points higher on the Lysholm score. However, there were no statistically significant differences in the Tegner activity scale or IKDC classification between the 2 groups. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic level I, randomized controlled clinical trial.

Context: Despite an increase in the literature, few definitive guidelines are available to determine when an athlete has been fully rehabilitated after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Objective: To examine countermovement jump and isokinetic dynamometry measures to (1) identify which measures can best distinguish between ACLR and control participants and (2) provide normative values for identified measures in young adult male multidirectional field-sport athletes. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Orthopaedic hospital. Patients or Other Participants: Young adult male multidirectional field-sport athletes (n = 118) who had undergone unilateral patellar-tendon graft ACLR at least±months earlier and healthy male participants (n = 44) with no previous knee injury. Intervention(s): Single-legged countermovement jump (SL CMJ). Main Outcome Measure(s): Three-dimensional biomechanical analysis of the SL CMJ and mean peak concentric knee-extension and -flexion torque using isokinetic dynamometry (ISO) were compared in the 2 groups. A stepwise logistic regression was carried out to identify the best predictors of ACLR- or control-group membership (SL CMJ height, limb symmetry index, peak power, joint power contribution, ISO peak torque, limb symmetry index variables). Results: The control group differed strongly from the ACLR group in isokinetic knee-extension peak torque (d = -1.33), SL CMJ performance (d > 0.4), and limb symmetry measures in both ISO and jump outcomes (d > 1.1). The combination of measures from both ISO and SL CMJ identified group membership with an accuracy of 89%. Conclusions: Rehabilitation of ACLR patients may be complete when they achieve isokinetic knee-extension peak torque of 260% (±40%) body mass, SL CMJ performance of >17 cm (±4 cm), and reach-limb symmetry measures of >90% in both strength and jump outcomes. The outcomes in the control group can inform return-to-play criteria for young adult male multidirectional field-sport athletes after ACLR.

Objective: To compare 3 anatomically positioned autografts for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, by measuring patient‐reported disease‐specific quality of life at 2 years postoperatively. Design: Double‐blinded, randomized clinical trial with intraoperative computer‐generated treatment allocation. Patients and an independent trained evaluator were blinded. Setting: University‐based orthopedic referral practice. Patients: Three hundred thirty patients (14‐50 years; 183 male patients) with isolated ACL deficiency were equally randomized to: (1) patellar tendon, PT: 28.7 years (SD = 9.7); (2) quadruple‐stranded hamstring tendon, HT: 28.5 years (SD = 9.9); and (3) double bundle using HT, DB: 28.3 years (SD = 9.8); 322 patients completed 2‐year follow‐up. Intervention: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using PT, HT, or DB autografts. Main Outcome Measures: Measured at baseline, 1 and 2 years postoperatively ‐ primary: anterior cruciate ligament quality‐of‐life scores; secondary: International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, KT‐1000 arthrometer, pivot shift, range of motion, Tegner activity, Cincinnati Occupational Scale, and single‐leg hop. Proportions of correct graft type guesses by the patients and evaluator assessed blinding effectiveness. Results: Baseline characteristics were not different. Anterior cruciate ligament quality‐of‐life scores increased over time for all groups (P = 0.001) but were not different at 2 years (P = 0.591): PT = 84.6 (SD = 16.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 81.4‐87.8), HT = 82.5 (SD = 17.7, 95% CI = 79.2‐85.9), and DB = 82.4 (SD = 17.5, 95% CI = 79.1‐85.7). Two‐year KT‐1000 side‐to‐side differences (PT = 1.86 mm; HT = 2.97 mm; DB = 2.65 mm) were statistically significant between PT‐HT (P = 0.002) and PT‐DB (P = 0.044). The remaining secondary outcomes were not statistically different. Correct graft type guesses occurred 51% of the time for patients and 46% for the evaluator. Conclusions: Two‐year disease‐specific quality‐of‐life outcome was not different between the ACL reconstruction techniques. The PT reconstructions had significantly lower side‐to‐side differences on static stability measures. Patient and evaluator blinding was achieved. Level of Evidence: Level 1 (Therapeutic Studies). Clinical Relevance: This high‐quality, large, double‐blind randomized clinical trial (RCT) addresses the insufficient evidence in the literature comparing PT, single‐bundle hamstring, and DB hamstring reconstructions for ACL rupture in adults. In addition to the clinical and functional results, this RCT uniquely reports on the disease‐specific, patient‐reported quality‐of‐life outcome at 2 years postoperatively.

BACKGROUND: Decreased psychological readiness for sport may contribute to poor return-tosport rates after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Though advanced rehabilitation is used to improve functional readiness for sport after ACLR, the effect of advanced rehabilitation on psychological readiness is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine changes in psychological and functional measures and readiness for sport based on these measures in patients with ACLR following advanced group training. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, patients with primary ACLR enrolled in a 5-week group training program after completing traditional physical therapy. Data collection pretraining and posttraining included demographic information, the Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) scale, and single-leg hop testing (single, triple, crossover triple, and timed hops). Readiness for sport was based on criteria for the ACL-RSI scale score (low threshold, 56 points or greater; high threshold, 75 points or greater) and hop tests (90% or greater limb symmetry). RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (21 male) participated. Mean ACL-RSI scale scores, mean hop test limb symmetry, and the proportion of patients meeting ACL-RSI and hop test readiness-for-sport criteria significantly improved from pretraining to posttraining. Posttraining ACL-RSI scale scores were correlated with single hop (r = 0.269) and triple hop (r = 0.275) limb symmetry, yet changes in the measures were not significantly correlated. After training, only 53.4% (lower ACL-RSI threshold) or 37.9% (higher ACL-RSI threshold) of the sample met both psychological and functional readiness criteria. CONCLUSION: Advanced group training following ACLR improved psychological and functional outcomes; however, further, individualized intervention may be needed to address residual deficiencies in some patients.

Background: In patients who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), the effect of neuromuscular re-education (NMR) programs on standard hop tests outcomes, including limb symmetry indices (LSIs), is unknown.Hypothesis: Both legs will show improvement in hop test-measured units after neuromuscular training, but the involved leg will show relatively greater improvement leading to improved limb symmetry. Patients younger than 18 years will show more improvement than patients who are older.Study Design: Retrospective cohort study.Level Of Evidence: Level 3.Methods: Patients self-selected their participation in this NMR program, which was completed after traditional outpatient physical therapy. Pre- and post-hop test scores were recorded as the primary outcome measure.Results: Seventy-one patients met the inclusion criteria and completed hop testing. Overall, the involved leg showed significant improvements (pretest/posttest) for single-leg hop (138.30 cm/156.89 cm), triple crossover hop (370.05 cm/423.11 cm), and timed hop (2.21 s/1.99 s). Similarly, on the uninvolved leg, improvements were seen for the single-leg hop (159.30 cm/171.87 cm) and triple crossover hop (427.50 cm/471.27 cm). Overall mean limb symmetry improved across all 4 hop tests, but there was significant improvement only on the single-leg hop (87% pretest to 92% posttest). Patients younger than 18 years showed mean significant LSI improvement on the triple crossover hop.Conclusion: Utilizing an intensive 6-week NMR program after ACLR prior to return to sport can improve quantitative hop test measurements. Patients younger than 18 years had greater improvement than those 18 years and older.Clinical Relevance: Advanced NMR programs can be successfully utilized in the postoperative ACLR setting to improve quantitative limb symmetry.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to compare the changes in bone mineral density (BMD) of three different ACL reconstruction (ACLR) techniques and its association with early clinical and functional outcomes. METHODS: Sixty‐two male adult patients undergoing primary ACLR were prospectively parallel randomized to bone‐patellar tendon‐bone graft (BPTB), single‐bundle (HT‐SB) or double‐bundle (HT‐DB) hamstring graft. BMD (primary outcome) at the proximal tibia, distal femur, femoral neck and trochanteric region was measured blindly at day 1, 3 months, 5 months and 1 year after surgery. KT‐1000, Lysholm, IKDC, one‐leg hop test and Lachman test were performed blindly at baseline and 1 year post‐reconstruction. RESULTS: There was a significant bone loss at the injured knee and hip at 3 and 5 months which was reversible at the knee, but not at the hip, at 1 year post‐operation. There was a significant improvement of early clinical and functional outcomes at 1 year. No significant differences in bone loss was detected among different surgical techniques, except BMD loss at the femoral neck, though a trend of greater BMD loss in the HT‐SB group at 5 months after reconstruction was observed. There was a significant positive correlation between BMD at the distal femur and the single‐leg hop distance at 1 year. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the three surgical techniques were similar in transient bone loss at the knee region, irreversible bone loss at the hip, early clinical and functional outcomes up to 1 year post‐reconstruction. BMD at the distal femur was positively associated with the single‐leg hop distance at 1 year post‐reconstruction.

STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study, cross-sectional. OBJECTIVES: To determine if self-reported knee function assessed with the International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 Subjective Knee Form (IKDC 2000) could discriminate between successful and nonsuccessful performance on return-to-activity criteria (RTAC) tests after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. BACKGROUND: Selecting appropriate performance-based and patient-reported tests that can detect side-to-side asymmetries, assess global knee function, and determine a participant's readiness to return to activity after ACL reconstruction can be a challenge for rehabilitation specialists. A simple tool or questionnaire to identify athletes with neuromuscular impairments or activity limitations could provide rehabilitation specialists with crucial data pertinent to their patients’ current knee function and readiness to return to higher-level activities. METHODS: One hundred ninety-four level I and level II athletes who underwent ACL reconstruction participated in the study. One hundred fifty-eight athletes at 6 months after ACL reconstruction and 141 of the athletes at 12 months after ACL reconstruction completed a battery of functional tests to determine readiness to return to activity and the IKDC 2000 to determine self-reported knee function. For each athlete, status on the RTAC test battery was dichotomized into “passed” or “failed,” and status on the IKDC 2000 scores was dichotomized into “within” or “below” age- and sex-matched normal ranges. Comparisons were made between status on the RTAC test battery and the IKDC 2000 using chi-square tests. Accuracy statistics were also calculated. RESULTS: Six months after ACL reconstruction, 112 athletes (70.9%) failed RTAC and 76 (48.1%) were classified as having self-reported knee function below normal ranges. Among the 76 participants with IKDC 2000 scores below normal ranges, 69 (90.8%) failed the RTAC test battery (P < .001). However, among the 82 participants whose IKDC 2000 scores were within normal limits at 6 months, only 39 (47.6%) passed the RTAC test battery (P = .74). Twelve months after ACL reconstruction, 67 athletes (47.5%) failed RTAC and 31 (22.0%) had knee function below normal ranges. Among the 31 participants with IKDC 2000 scores below normal ranges, 25 (80.6%) failed the RTAC test battery (P < .001). However, among the 110 participants whose IKDC 2000 scores were within normal limits at 12 months, only 68 (61.8%) passed the RTAC test battery (P = .017). CONCLUSION: The IKDC 2000 may be a clinically relevant tool to determine the timeliness or necessity of RTAC testing. For scores obtained 6 and 12 months after ACL reconstruction, low IKDC 2000 scores were reasonably indicative of failure on the RTAC test battery, whereas normal IKDC 2000 scores were not predictive of passing scores on the RTAC test battery.

Objective return to sport (RTS) criteria after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury are lacking. Study purposes were (1) to report Limb Symmetry Index (LSI) values achieved in a test battery, (2) to detect how many subjects meet RTS criteria 12–18 months post-operative and (3) to identify whether patient-administered scores predict RTS criteria. Observer-blinded, cross-sectional observational study. Traumacenter Linz, Austria. Eighty-eight subjects (48 females; mean (SD) age: 34.73 (10.8) years); Twenty-five had undergone ACL repair (IB), 21 ACL reconstruction (AI). Forty-two healthy subjects served as control. Participants were evaluated using a single-leg hop test battery. The variable of interest was meeting the RTS criteria by reaching defined cut-off values. Logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between subjective scores (IKDC, WOMAC, KOOS, Lysholm) and fulfillment of RTS criteria. Additionally, subjective physical activity and anterior knee translation were assessed. Thirty-six percent of IB patients and 28.6% of AI patients met RTS criteria. None of the included scores produced significant odds to predict RTS. Subjective scores, clinical examinations and fulfillment of RTS criteria did not differ significantly between groups. Maximum anterior translation revealed a significant difference (p = 0.009) in favor of the AI group. • A premature return-to-sport attempt might contribute to re-injury of the knee. • Knee scores did not produce significant odds to predict return-to-sport criteria. • Functional testing is recommended before return-to-sport.

Background: Additional high-quality prospective studies are needed to better define the objective criteria used in relation to return-to-sport decisions after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in active populations. Purpose: To investigate prospectively the relationship between functional performance test results at 24 weeks postoperative and return-to-sport activity (Tegner activity score) at 12 and 24 months, respectively, after synthetic (ligament advanced reinforcement system [LARS]) and autograft (doubled semitendinosus/gracilis [2ST/2GR]) ACL reconstructions. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A total of 64 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction (32 LARS, 32 2ST/2GR autograft; mean age, 27.9 years; body mass index [BMI], 24.9 kg/m2) were assessed preoperatively and at staged intervals postoperatively up to 24 weeks for isokinetic testing of quadriceps and hamstring average power per repetition at 60 deg/s and 180 deg/s, a battery of hop tests, peak vertical ground-reaction force (vGRF), and time to peak vGRF (in seconds) during a step- and jump-down task onto a force platform and peak speed (m/s) using a global positioning system (GPS unit) during a running task. A cohort of 32 healthy matched participants (mean age, 26.31 years; BMI, 25.7 kg/m2) were also tested to act as reference. Pearson correlation was calculated to assess correlation of each performance measure at 24 weeks postoperative with activity outcomes (Tegner score) at 12 and 24 months. Results: The strongest correlation between physical performance tests and return-to-sport outcomes was observed with peak speed during running. Large correlations were also observed for hamstring isokinetic power and hop test for distance. Moderate correlations were observed for timed hop, peak vGRF during a jump-down task, and quadriceps isokinetic power. No statistical correlations were observed for time to peak vGRF during a step-down and jump-down task as well as peak vGRF during a step-down task. When the performance tests were pooled together, mean postoperative improvements of 24% were observed from preoperative to 24 weeks within the surgical cohort. For each performance test, preoperative level of function strongly correlated with performance levels on the same test at 24 weeks. Discussion: The results of this study indicate that clinicians might seek to prioritize these tests and the rehabilitation themes they imply when seeking to maximize postoperative ACL activity outcomes. The observed strength between pre- and postoperative performance tests and return-to-sport outcomes within this study highlights the potential value of preoperative conditioning before undergoing ACL reconstruction. Future research should examine absolute predictive criterion thresholds for functional performance-based tests and reinjury risk reduction after ACL reconstruction.

Background: The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) and identify the factors that affect PFOA development after single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with hamstring autograft. We hypothesized that detecting these factors could be helpful in establishment of a rehabilitation strategy to focus on the modifiable factors., Methods: Of the 324 patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction between January 2010 and June 2013, 92 patients who were available for follow-up for a minimum of 36 months after the surgery and underwent second-look arthroscopy were enrolled. Subjective assessments and clinical outcome evaluation were conducted. Arthroscopic cartilage evaluation was done using the Outerbridge classification. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used., Results: Ninety-two patients were evaluated at an average of 38.9 +/- 5.4 months of follow-up. PFOA above grade 2 was observed in 19 patients (20.7%) at the second-look arthroscopy. Of them, three patients with pre-existing PFOA (3.3%) showed progression of the Outerbridge grade, and 16 (17.4%) had newly developed PFOA. According to the multivariable logistic regression analysis, isokinetic extensor deficit at 60degree/sec at the last follow-up (odds ratio [OR], 2.193; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.081 to 12.439; p = 0.031), age at primary surgery (OR, 1.118; 95% CI, 1.019 to 1.227; p = 0.018), and concurrent meniscectomy at primary surgery (OR, 0.091; 95% CI, 1.012 to 1.177; p = 0.023) were the significant predictors of PFOA development., Conclusions: Significant predictors of PFOA after ACL reconstruction with hamstring autograft were decreased quadriceps strength at last follow-up, increased age, and concurrent meniscectomy at primary surgery. Quadriceps weakness as a modifiable factor should be considered in the establishment of a rehabilitation strategy to prevent PFOA after ACL reconstruction, especially in older age.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify the correlations between the single-leg vertical jump (SLVJ) test and subjective and objective tests which were used widely for determining return-to-sports (RTS) after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR)., METHODS: Seventy-five patients (29.5+/-9.2years) who underwent ACLR between May 2012 and Jan 2014 were included. Subjective knee scoring systems including subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, Tegner activity scale, and ACL-Return to Sports after Injury (ACL-RSI) scale were assessed. Objective tests were also performed., RESULTS: The limb symmetry index (LSI) for SLVJ test and single-leg hop for distance (SLHD) test was 89.4+/-14.9% and 90.7+/-11.7%. LSI for SLVJ test was correlated to subjective IKDC scores (r=0.26, P=0.024), Tegner activity scale (r=0.64, P<0.001), ACL-RSI scale (r=0.61, P<0.001), LSI for SLHD (r=0.45, P<0.001), Co-contraction (r=-0.57, P<0.001), Shuttle run (r=-0.52, P<0.001), and Carioca (r=-0.54, P<0.001) tests. In isokinetic strength tests, extensor peak torque (r=0.30, P=0.009) and extensor strength deficit (r=-0.41, P<0.001) were correlated with LSI for SLVJ test., CONCLUSION: There were considerable correlations between SLVJ test and subjective IKDC scores, Tegner activity scale, ACL-RSI scale, isokinetic extensor muscle strength, and all other functional tests. SLVJ test could be used conveniently to determine RTS after ACLR in outpatient clinics., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, case series. Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Background: This study aimed to determine the effects of single semitendinosus tendon (ST) harvesting for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction by comparing outcomes of single ST and semitendinosus-gracilis tendon (ST-G) harvesting., Methods: ACL reconstruction with ST-G harvesting (D group, n = 60) or single ST harvesting (S group, n = 60) were included according to inclusion criteria. Subjective assessments included subjective International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity scale score. Objective assessments included isokinetic strength and functional tests. These tests were completed at 36 months of follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and second-look arthroscopy findings were evaluated. In the S group, regeneration properties were assessed by serial ultrasonography (US)., Results: The S group showed significantly less deep flexor strength deficit than the D group (p < 0.001). Deep flexor power deficits showed significant correlation with the shift of musculotendinous junction of the ST. There was significant difference in the cocontraction test between the groups (p = 0.012), and the S group tended to show better results in other functional tests at the last follow-up. There were no significant differences in graft tension and synovial coverage on second-look arthroscopy between the groups. In the S group, the regeneration rates assessed by US at the joint line and distal insertion were 81.7% and 80%, respectively at 6 months of follow-up., Conclusions: The S group showed significantly less deficit in deep flexor strength and tended to show better clinical results at the last follow-up than the D group. In the S group, more than 80% showed good regeneration at the 6-month follow-up. Hence, single ST harvesting is effective in minimizing flexor weakness and functional deficits and shows great potential for regeneration.

Background: Few studies have reported the healing process of anterolateral ligament (ALL) injuries. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study investigated the healing status of ALL injuries after primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR). Additionally, we investigated the association between the healing status of ALL injuries and associated lesions such as osseous lesions and meniscal tears occurring at the time of an ACL rupture. We hypothesized that acute ALL injuries show a high rate (more than two-thirds) of healing at the 1-year follow-up after ACLR and that concomitant lesions observed at the time of an ACL rupture affect the healing status of the ALL. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: We retrospectively investigated patients with ALL injuries who underwent primary ACLR between March 2015 and February 2017. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we evaluated the features of ALL injuries and concomitant lesions, and MRI was performed at the 1-year follow-up to assess the healing status of the ALL. We investigated the association between the healing status of the ALL and concomitant lesions observed at the time of an ACL rupture. A subjective assessment was performed using the Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee subjective score, and Tegner activity scale. Objective tests included an isokinetic strength assessment and functional performance testing. Results: With respect to the severity of ALL injuries, of 54 patients, a complete rupture occurred in 16 (29.6%) of the 54 patients and a partial rupture in 38 (70%). A significant association was observed between the severity of ALL injuries and bone contusions (lateral tibial plateau and medial tibial plateau [MTP]) and meniscus ramp lesions (Fisher exact test: P =.023,.012, and.023, respectively). Good and partial healing of the ALL occurred in 16 (29.6%) and 23 (42.6%) of 54 patients, respectively. Scar formation occurred in 12 (22.2%), and nonvisualization of the ALL was observed in 3 (5.6%) of 54 patients. Poor healing of the ALL was associated with preoperative MTP bone contusions and a high-grade pivot shift. Multivariate analysis showed that an MTP bone contusion was an independent risk factor associated with poor healing of the ALL. Among the functional tests performed, significant differences were observed between the good and poor healing groups with respect to the carioca test (P =.039). The good healing group (n = 16) showed a negative pivot shift at the last follow-up, whereas 5 (13.2%) of the patients from the poor healing group (n = 38) showed a positive pivot shift, including 2 (5.3%) with a high-grade pivot shift. Conclusion: Approximately 70% of acute ALL injuries showed poor healing at the 1-year follow-up. Poor healing of ALL injuries was significantly associated with preoperative MTP bone contusions and a high-grade pivot shift. Therefore, a careful assessment of posteromedial bone contusions at the time of an ACL rupture is warranted, particularly in patients with a high-grade pivot shift.

Purposes: To compare the clinical and functional results of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using an autologous four-strand single semitendinosus (ST) tendon or a ST and gracilis tendon. It was hypothesized that successful ACL reconstruction using a single ST tendon without the gracilis tendon could provide comparable knee stability and reduce donor site morbidity.Methods: This study evaluated 144 cases of single-bundle ACL reconstruction using an autologous hamstring tendon. The ST group included 85 cases of reconstruction using a single ST tendon, and the ST/G group included 59 cases of reconstruction using a ST tendon and a gracilis tendon. An extracortical suspension device and a suture tied around a screw post with an additional bioabsorbable screw were used to fix the femoral and tibial tunnels, respectively. Clinical evaluations involved the Lachman, pivot-shift, and one-leg hop tests; an isokinetic test; a KT-2000 arthrometer; an assessment of return to pre-injury activities; and Lysholm, Tegner activity, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective scores.Results: No significant differences were found between the ST and ST/G groups with respect to the Lysholm, Tegner activity, and subjective IKDC scores; the Lachman, pivot-shift, and one-leg hop tests; KT-2000 arthrometer side-to-side differences; or return to pre-injury activities. However, mean peak torque deficit, as determined using the isokinetic test during flexion at 60°/s, was significantly lower in the ST group than in the ST/G group (p = 0.047).Conclusion: This study showed good results for ACL reconstruction using a single ST tendon without deterioration of stability. This provides the evidence that ACL reconstruction using a single ST tendon without the gracilis tendon decreases donor site morbidity without compromising joint stability.Level Of Evidence: IV.

BACKGROUND: The decision as to whether or not an athlete is ready to return to sport (RTS) after ACL reconstruction is difficult as the commonly used RTS criteria have not been validated., PURPOSE: To evaluate whether a set of objective discharge criteria, including muscle strength and functional tests, are associated with risk of ACL graft rupture after RTS., MATERIALS AND METHODS: 158 male professional athletes who underwent an ACL reconstruction and returned to their previous professional level of sport were included. Before players returned to sport they underwent a battery of discharge tests (isokinetic strength testing at 60degree, 180degree and 300degree/s, a running t test, single hop, triple hop and triple crossover hop tests). Athletes were monitored for ACL re-ruptures once they returned to sport (median follow-up 646 days, range 1-2060)., RESULTS: Of the 158 athletes, 26 (16.5%) sustained an ACL graft rupture an average of 105 days after RTS. Two factors were associated with increased risk of ACL graft rupture: (1) not meeting all six of the discharge criteria before returning to team training (HR 4.1, 95% CI 1.9 to 9.2, p<=0.001); and (2) decreased hamstring to quadriceps ratio of the involved leg at 60degree/s (HR 10.6 per 10% difference, 95% CI 10.2 to 11, p=0.005)., CONCLUSIONS: Athletes who did not meet the discharge criteria before returning to professional sport had a four times greater risk of sustaining an ACL graft rupture compared with those who met all six RTS criteria. In addition, hamstring to quadriceps strength ratio deficits were associated with an increased risk of an ACL graft rupture. Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

BACKGROUND: Relatively little is known about the longitudinal changes in strength and function in the early phase compared to long term outcome following reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). OBJECTIVE: To assess the isokinetic concentric strength of the knee extensors and flexors as well as the distance jumped in the one-legged hop test in patients before and at 3, 6 and 12 months after (6 and 12 months for the hop test) reconstruction of the ACL. METHOD: Seventy-three men, aged 18-50 years took part in the study. The primary outcome measures were the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery and one-legged hop test at 6 and 12 months after post-reconstruction. RESULTS: There was a consistent increase in muscular strength between 3 and 12 months post-reconstruction. Fair but significant correlations were found between the IKDC score at 12 months and the peak moment of the knee extensors at 3 and 6 months (r = 0.450 and 0.429, respectively, p = 0.012). 60.2% of the participants satisfied the criteria of successful outcome based on IKDC scores and one-legged hop test at 12 months. The peak moment of knee extensor measured at 3 months after surgery was a significant predictive factor for successful outcome (p = 0.021). Patients in whom muscle strength had recovered well by 3 months after ACL reconstruction were more active in terms of sporting activities and exhibited better dynamic performance at the 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSION: Knee extension strengthening in early phase is crucial to restoring sporting performance after ACL reconstruction.

The purpose of this study was to determine if quadriceps strength and functional outcomes were similar at 6 months following anterior cruciate ligament [ACL] reconstruction in patients receiving a continuous 48-hour femoral nerve blockade for postoperative analgesia (FNB group) versus patients with no FNB (control group). A retrospective cohort was designed including athletes who underwent primary ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon autograft between 2005 and 2010 at our institution with identical rehabilitation protocols. The FNB group included 96 patients with an average age of 21 years and the control group included 100 patients with an average age of 20 years. At 6 months following ACL reconstruction, isokinetic strength (slow and fast activation) and functional tests including vertical jump, single hop, triple hop, and return to sport were analyzed with an alpha value < 0.05 as significant. Multivariate regression models were used to compare these outcomes between the FNB and control groups after adjusting for gender and competitive athlete status. At 6 months, fast extension isokinetic strength was inferior in the FNB group (78 vs. 85%; p < 0.01). After adjusting for gender and competitive athlete status, fast (p = 0.002) and slow extension strength (p = 0.01), vertical jump (p = 0.03) and single jump (p = 0.02) were also inferior in the FNB group. There were no significant differences in full return to sport between the two groups (86% at 7.5 months in the FNB group vs. 93% at 7.3 months in the control group). In this retrospective comparative study, the hypothesis that patients treated with continuous FNB for postoperative analgesia following ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon autograft will have inferior knee extension (quadriceps) strength and function at 6 months follow-up was affirmed. However, no differences were observed in return to sport, bringing into question whether these statistical differences translate into meaningful clinical consequences after ACL reconstruction. The level of evidence was level III, retrospective case-control series. Copyright Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this 2‐year follow‐up study is to compare the clinical outcomes of the routine use of 5‐strand hamstring grafts (where possible) with those of 4‐strand grafts in primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The hypothesis was that the routine use of 5‐strand grafts would lead to superior clinical outcomes. METHODS: A total of 64 patients were enrolled in a prospective randomized controlled study comparing the use of 5‐strand and 4‐strand semitendinosus‐gracilis autografts in single bundle ACL reconstruction (n=32 in each group). 4 participants in each group were lost to follow‐up, and were excluded from the outcomes analysis. The outcomes of 28 patients in the 5‐strand group and 28 patients in the 4‐strand group were analyzed. The diameters of all grafts were measured intra‐operatively. Patients were assessed post‐operatively at 2‐years with objective assessments (anterior knee laxity using the KT‐2000 arthrometer, Lachman test, Pivot‐shift test, Hop test) and patient reported outcome scores (Lysholm knee score, KOOS, IKDC subjective knee score, SF‐36 physical and mental components, Tegner activity scale). Post‐operative graft ruptures were also noted. RESULTS: There were improvements in all outcome measures post‐operatively regardless of the number of graft strands. Comparing the study and control groups, there were no significant differences in all subjective and objective outcome measures except the KOOS symptoms score (5‐strand group 93.3 ± 9.2 vs 4‐strand group 86.2 ± 14.7, p=0.04). The KT‐2000 side to side difference was 2.79 ± 2.11mm in the 5‐strand group, and 2.54 ± 1.75mm in the 4‐strand group (p=0.63). The 5‐strand study group had two graft ruptures at 1 year, while the 4‐strand control group had one partial graft rupture at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: At the 2‐year follow‐up, the routine use of the 5‐strand hamstring tendon autograft was not superior to that of the quadrupled or 4‐strand graft in primary ACL reconstruction.

Purpose: Quadriceps strength and single-leg hop performance are commonly evaluated prior to return to sport after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). However, few studies have documented potential hip strength deficits after ACLR, or ascertained the relative contribution of quadriceps and hip strength to hop performance.Methods: Patients cleared for return to sports drills after ACLR were compared to a control group. Participants' peak isometric knee extension, hip abduction, hip extension, and hip external rotation (HER) strength were measured. Participants also performed single-leg hops, timed hops, triple hops, and crossover hops. Between-limb comparisons for the ACLR to control limb and the non-operative limb were made using independent two-sample and paired sample t tests. Pearson's correlations and stepwise multiple linear regression were used to determine the relationships and predictive ability of limb strength, graft type, sex, and limb dominance to hop performance.Results: Sixty-five subjects, 20 ACLR [11F, age 22.8 (15-45) years, 8.3 ± 2 months post-op, mass 70.47 ± 12.95 kg, height 1.71 ± 0.08 m, Tegner 5.5 (3-9)] and 45 controls [22F, age 25.8 (15-45) years, mass 74.0 ± 15.2 kg, height 1.74 ± 0.1 m, Tegner 6 (3-7)], were tested. Knee extension (4.4 ± 1.5 vs 5.4 ± 1.8 N/kg, p = 0.02), HER (1.4 ± 0.4 vs 1.7 ± 0.5 N/kg, p = 0.04), single-leg hop (146 ± 37 vs 182 ± 38% limb length, p < 0.01), triple hop (417 ± 106 vs 519 ± 102% limb length, p < 0.01), timed hop (3.3 ± 2.0 vs 2.3 ± 0.6 s, p < 0.01), and crossover hop (364 ± 107 vs 446 ± 123% limb length, p = 0.01) were significantly impaired in the operative versus control subject limbs. Similar deficits existed between the operative and non-operative limbs. Knee extension and HER strength were significantly correlated with each of the hop tests, but only HER significantly predicted hop performance.Conclusions: After ACLR, patients have persistent HER strength, knee extension strength, and hop test deficits in the operative limb compared to the control and non-operative limbs, even after starting sport-specific drills. Importantly, HER strength independently predicted hop performance. Based on these findings, to resolve between-limb deficits in strength and hop performance clinicians should include HER strengthening exercises in post-operative rehabilitation.Level Of Evidence: Prognostic Study, Level II.

INTRODUCTION: Previous studies examining jump tasks after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) have focused on performance measures without examining joint kinematic and kinetic variables. The aim of this study was to identify differences in biomechanical and performance measures between limbs across tests 9 months after surgery., METHODS: Four jump tests (double-leg drop jump (DLDJ), single-leg drop jump (SLDJ), single-leg hop for distance (SLHD) and hurdle hop (HH)) were carried out on 156 male subjects in a 3D motion capture laboratory 9 months after surgery. Statistical parametric mapping was used to identify differences in jump performance and biomechanical variables between limbs., RESULTS: Biomechanical measures were lower on the ACLR side across all four tests for internal knee valgus moment (effect size 0.78-0.96, knee internal rotation angle 0.59-0.73, and 0.60-0.83), respectively. [corrected]. The timing of the largest difference between limbs was not at the same % stance between variables within a test or for any variable across tests. Large ES differences were observed in performance in the SLDJ (ES 0.73-0.81; LSI 78%) and small differences in the SLHD (ES 0.36; LSI 94%) between the limbs., CONCLUSION: Findings highlighted biomechanical differences between limbs which are consistent across jump tasks suggesting insufficient rehabilitation at 9 months post surgery. Results indicate that the SLDJ may identify greater performance deficits between limbs than SLHD, which may over-estimate rehabilitation status. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

There has been controversy about whether remnant tissue of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) has to be preserved in ACL reconstruction. The purpose of the study was to compare clinical outcomes between groups of patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft divided according to amount of ACL remnant and investigate effect of remnant preservation on outcomes of ACL reconstruction. A total of 185 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with BPTB autograft were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into four groups according to proportion of length of remnant tissue of injured ACL covering part of reconstructed ACL to total length of reconstructed ACL: group A included 83 patients with no remnant, group B consisted of 38 patients with remnant of < 1/3, group C consisted of 35 patients with remnant of 1/3 to2/3, and group D consisted of 29 patients with remnant of > 2/3. Primary outcome was International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score. Secondary outcomes were stability, range of motion, patient-reported outcomes determined by Lysholm knee scoring scale and Tegner activity scale, IKDC objective grade, and single hop for distance. Return to activity and near-return to activity were investigated. A minimum follow-up duration was 24 months. There was no statistically significant difference between four groups regarding postoperative anterior translation (p = 0.731), Lysholm knee score (p = 0.599), IKDC objective grade (p > 0.999), hop test (p = 0.878), and near-return to activity (p = 0.193). However, patients of group D had significantly better outcomes in IKDC subjective score (group A = 85.0 +/- 5.9, group B = 84.9 +/- 8.1, group C = 87.4 +/- 6.4, group D = 89.2 +/- 8.1, p = 0.017), Tegner activity scale (group A = 5.0 +/- 1.1, group B = 5.2 +/- 1.0, group C = 5.7 +/- 1.3, group D = 5.9 +/- 1.0, p = 0.001), and return to activity (group A = 25.3%, group B = 31.6%, group C = 45.7%, group D = 55.2%, p = 0.014). ACL reconstruction using BPTB autograft with remnant preservation did not provide better anterior stability compared with conventional ACL reconstruction. However, preservation of remnant of > 2/3 led to more improved activity-related clinical outcomes than no remnant preservation. In cases with substantial remnant tissue of injured ACL remaining, reconstruction of ACL while preserving as much remnant tissue as possible is recommended. This is a Level III, retrospective comparative therapeutic study. Copyright Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of hamstring harvesting in patients after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction by comparing groups with and without hamstring harvesting. Method(s): We evaluated the effect of hamstring harvesting in 73 consecutive patients who underwent ACL reconstruction: 39 patients whose hamstrings were harvested for autografts (group H) were compared with 34 patients who received allografts during the same time period (group C [control]). The cases and controls were compared by analyzing the following variables: age, height, weight, mean follow-up period, type of tissue used, and meniscal surgery. Outcomes were assessed by the Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity score, and KT-2000 side-to-side difference (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), as well as functional performance tests. The flexor deficit and isokinetic peak torque for knee flexion were measured in the sitting position (0degree to 90degree), and the flexion torque at 90degree was measured in the prone position (60degree to 120degree). Result(s): Although significant knee flexion weakness after ACL reconstruction was observed, a significantly greater knee flexor deficit was found in autograft patients than in allograft patients (P <.001). No differences were found between groups in terms of clinical and functional results regardless of hamstring harvesting. The performance of both study groups in all 4 functional tests were significantly correlated with flexor deficit in the sitting position (P <.05) but not in hyperflexion. Significant flexor deficits in both normal and hyperflexed positions were noted in both groups when compared with the unaffected knee (group H, P <.001; group C, P =.002). Conclusion(s): These results indicate significant knee flexion weakness compared with the unaffected knee after ACL reconstruction regardless of hamstring harvesting. Moreover, the greater increase in knee flexor deficit in the hamstring-harvested group compared with the allograft group was statistically significant. However, clinical and functional outcomes were similar between the groups. © 2011 Arthroscopy Association of North America.

Background: Clinicians are often challenged when making return-to-play decisions following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R). Isokinetic strength and jump performance testing are common tools used to make this decision. Unfortunately, vertical jump performance standards have notbeen clearly established and many clinicians do not have access to isokinetic testing equipment. Purpose: To establish normative jump and strength characteristics in ACL-R patients cleared by an orthopedic physician to return-to-play and to determine if relationships exist between knee isokinetic strength measurements and jump characteristics described using an electronic jump map system. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Thirty-three ACL-R patients who had been cleared to return to athletic competition participated in this study. Twenty-six of these ACL-R participants were also matched to 26 asymptomatic athletes based on sex, limb, height, and mass to determine isokinetic strength and jump characteristic differences between groups. Jump tests consisted of single leg vertical, double leg vertical, and a 4-jump single leg vertical jump assessed using an electronic jump mat system. Independent t-tests were used to determine differences between groups and multiple regression analyses were used to identify any relationships between jump performance and knee strength (p < 0.05). Results: The ACL-R group had lower vertical jump capabilities and some bilateral knee strength deficiencies compared to the matched control group. The ACL-R group also showed several moderate-to-strong positive relationships for both knee extension and flexion strength with several jump performance characteristics, such as single and double leg vertical jump height. Conclusion: The current results indicate that ACL-R patients present with several knee strength and vertical jump differences compared to a matched control group at the time of return-to-play. Also, ACL-R patient's performance on an electronic jump mat system is strongly related to isokinetic knee strength measures.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this prospective randomized study was to compare the outcomes of the anatomic double‐bundle (DB) and anatomic single‐bundle (SB) techniques 5 years after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Since more effective restoration of rotational laxity is considered the main advantage of the DB technique, the pivot‐shift test was the primary outcome variable of the study. HYPOTHESIS: Double‐bundle ACL reconstruction will result in a better outcome in terms of the pivot‐shift test. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: A total of 105 patients (33 women, 72 men; median age, 27 years; range, 18‐52 years) were randomized and underwent ACL reconstruction (DB group, n = 53; SB group, n = 52). All reconstructions were performed anatomically by identifying the ACL footprints, using the anteromedial portal for the femoral tunnel drilling, and utilizing interference screw for tibial and femoral fixation. A single blinded observer examined the patients preoperatively and at follow‐up (median, 64 months; range, 55‐75 months). Multiple subjective and objective clinical evaluation tests and radiographic assessments of osteoarthritis (OA) were performed using the Ahlbäck, Kellgren‐Lawrence, and Fairbank grading systems at 6 weeks postoperatively and at the final follow‐up evaluation. RESULTS: Preoperatively, no differences were found between the study groups, apart from the preinjury Tegner activity level, which was lower in the DB group (SB: mean, 7.8 [range, 3‐9]; DB: mean, 7.3 [range, 0‐9]; P = .02). Eighty‐seven patients (83%) were available for examination at the 5‐year follow‐up. Statistical differences could not be found between the groups in terms of the pivot‐shift test, KT‐1000 arthrometer laxity measurements, manual Lachman test, single‐legged‐hop test, square‐hop test, range of motion, Lysholm knee scoring scale, Tegner activity scale, or Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. Correspondingly, no differences were found between the groups regarding the presence of OA at follow‐up. However, a significant increase of OA was found within the DB group at the 5‐year follow‐up. Both groups improved at follow‐up compared with the preoperative assessment in terms of the laxity tests, hop tests, and scoring scales. CONCLUSION: At the 5‐year follow‐up of an unselected group of patients, anatomic DB reconstruction was not superior to anatomic SB reconstruction in terms of the pivot‐shift test.

OBJECTIVE: Whether surgical or conservative treatment is more effective in allowing patients to return to physical activity after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is controversial. We sought to compare mid-term outcome measures between isolated ACL tear patients who underwent reconstruction followed by closed kinetic chain exercises and those who underwent neuromuscular training only., METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated patients with ACL tears who underwent post-surgery CKC strength training after ACL reconstruction (Group A), and patients who only underwent neuromuscular training (Group B) with a minimum follow-up time of 5 years. Surgical techniques, rehabilitation, assessment of subjective knee function, one-leg hop test, assessment of joint position sense, muscle strength, and the health profile of the patient were evaluated., RESULTS: Overall, 43 patients were included in Group A (mean age, 32.56 +/- 4.89; Tegner activity scale, 5) and 39 patients in Group B (31.67 +/- 7.27; 5). Patients in both groups returned to their regular physical activity level after a similar time frame (Group A: average, 12 months; Group B, average, 13.4 months). The mean Lysholm knee score was 88.52 +/- 7.65 in Group A and 86.21 +/- 13.72 in Group B. Mean distances for the one-leg hop test for Group A were 135.21 +/- 31.66 and 145.36 +/- 42.10 mm in the reconstructed and uninjured knees, respectively. In Group B, the mean hop distances were 132.47 +/- 28.13 and 147.89 +/- 21.45 mm in the rehabilitated and uninjured knees, respectively. No statistical difference was observed between the groups for any of the parameters evaluated, including assessment of subjective knee function, one-leg hop test, assessment of joint position sense, muscle strength, and the health profile., CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that early surgical reconstruction may not be a prerequisite to returning to recreational physical activities after injury in patients with ACL tears., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.

Purpose: Several studies have suggested that drilling the femoral tunnel through an anteromedial arthroscopic portal during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction allows more anatomic placement of the graft. However, no studies have investigated whether the anteromedial approach results in better outcomes compared to the traditional transtibial drilling approach when a hamstring autograft is used. The purpose of the present study is to investigate short-term functional and clinical outcome differences between male patients recovering from anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with a hamstring autograft using the transtibial femoral tunnel drilling approach versus the anteromedial approach.Methods: Lysholm score, functional test and isokinetic data were collected at 3 and 6 months after surgery in 51 male patients who received a standardized rehabilitation in a large outpatient facility. Multivariate and univariate analyses of variance were used to assess group, time and interaction effects.Results: All outcomes except isokinetic knee flexion at 180°/s improved from 3 to 6 months for both groups (p ≤ 0.05). The anteromedial approach group had better Lysholm scores at 3 months (p ≤ 0.05) and better performance in the timed lateral movement functional tests at 3 and 6 months (p ≤ 0.05). No other comparisons were significant (n.s).Conclusions: Both groups had comparable outcomes on most measures. The differences in the Lysholm score and lateral movement functional tests may suggest a quicker return of function and performance for the anteromedial approach group. Clinicians should take into consideration the surgical technique as they progress patients recovering from ACL reconstruction through the different phases of the rehabilitation protocol.Level Of Evidence: Therapeutic study, Level II.

Introduction: ACL reconstruction with either patellar tendon or semitendinosus tendon autografts are standard procedures. Between these two grafts might be differences in stability, morbidity, or long‐term changes. This study investigates outcomes of ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon versus semitendinosus tendon autografts. We hypothesize no significant differences in clinical outcome and knee stability between both groups. Methods: In a randomized prospective trial, we operated 62 ACL‐deficient patients, 45 males and 17 females with a mean age of 29.8 years (min. 18, max. 44). We reconstructed the ligament using either autologous patellar tendon (n = 31) or semitendinosus tendon (n = 31). After 10 years of follow‐up, we investigated 47 patients of the study. For evaluation we used a standard clinical examination including one‐leg jump test and KT‐1000 instrumental translation measure, visual analog pain scale, IKDC subjective knee form, Lysholm score, Tegner activity scale, and standard X‐rays of the knee. Results: The data did not show any significant differences between the two groups. Between 5 and 10 years after ACL reconstruction both groups started to develop degenerative arthritic changes, which were detectable in standard radiographs of the knee. At 10‐year follow‐up mean IKDC for the BPTB group was 1.8 (min. 1, max. 3) and for the ST group it was 2.2 (min 1, max. 4), p = 0.35. Regarding Tegner activity scale after 10 years, the BPTB group showed a mean score of 5.9 (min. 4, max. 9) versus 5.1 (min. 3, max. 7) in the ST group, p = 0.53. For the Lysholm score the BPTB group reached a mean of 92.0 (min. 63, max. 98) and the ST group 91.8 (min. 62, max. 98) points, p = 0.66. There is a tendency for higher donor site morbidity in the BPTB group than in the ST group, p = 0.07. Conclusions: Both, patellar tendon and semitendinosus tendon are safe autografts for ACL reconstruction. Regarding graft selection, individual patient‐dependent factors should be considered. ACL reconstruction cannot fully restore pre‐injury status of knee joint function in the majority of cases.

BACKGROUND: Although the effect of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is good, the postoperative muscle strength is still absent and the motor function cannot be fully recovered. OBJECTIVE(S): To observe the muscle strength and functional performance of the affected limbs after ACL reconstruction using semitendonosus and gracilis as a autograft, so as to guide the rehabilitation of patients with ACL reconstruction. METHOD(S): Totally 150 patients with ACL injuries participated in this study. All patients underwent ACL reconstruction using semitendonosus and gracilis as an autograft and rehabilitation. Extension and flexion torques were measured for the injured and healthy limbs at postoperative 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, and the quadriceps strength symmetry index, hamstring/quadriceps ratio were measured. The single hop test, the 6-m timed hop test, crossover hop test and the side-to-side hop test were conducted at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. The changes of muscle strength and motor function with time were analyzed and evaluated. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): (1) Of the 150 patients, only 118 patients completed all tests, and 32 patients (21.3 %) lost to follow up. (2) The average quadriceps strength of the affected side at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postoperatively was (64.01+/-4.45)%, (77.97+/-5.04)%, (84.25+/-5.14)% and (86.98+/-5.28)% of the healthy side, respectively. The average hamstring strength of the affected side at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postoperatively was (81.58+/-3.12)%, (91.06+/-3.72)%, (96.48+/-3.87)% and (97.59+/-3.77)% of the healthy side, respectively. Repeated measurement test confirmed that the flexor/extensor strength gradually recovered with time (F=27.23, P=0.00). (3) Muscle strength recovered quickly between 3 and 6 months (P < 0.05). The quadriceps strength of involved limb was still significantly lower than the uninvolved limb after 12 months (P < 0.05). The hamstring muscle was not significantly different from the uninvolved limb after 12 months (P > 0.05). (4) At 3, 6, 9 and 12 months postoperatively, hamstring/quadriceps ratios were significantly higher than the healthy limb (P < 0.05). (5) At 6 months postoperatively, results of the single hop test, crossover hop test, the side-to-side hop test and the 6-m timed hop test were lower than 90% of the healthy limb. At 12 months postoperatively, results of the single hop test and the 6-m timed hop test were higher than 90% of the healthy limb, but crossover hop test and the side-to-side hop test were still lower than 90% of the healthy limb. (6) These results manifest that the best period for the restoration of flexion and extension strength is 3-6 months postoperatively. The extensor muscle strength, hamstring/ quadriceps strength ratios and sport ability of the patients are not completely restored to normal at 12 months postoperatively.Copyright © 2018, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

Context: Some studies have discussed postoperative quadriceps strength recovery after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). However, the effect of preoperative quadriceps strength deficit on longitudinal postoperative quadriceps strength recovery after ACLR with hamstring autograft is unknown. Objective: To reveal the longitudinal postoperative quadriceps strength recovery after ACLR with hamstring autograft among patient groups stratified by preoperative quadriceps strength deficit. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Single center. Patients: In total, 420 patients (222 men and 218 women; age at the time of surgery 23.1 [8.9] y) who underwent ipsilateral ACLR with hamstring autograft and completed knee function tests preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively were included in this study. Intervention: The authors measured quadriceps strength at 60°/s, tested 1-leg hop performance (distance and anxiety), and calculated the quadriceps strength index (QSI) and limb symmetry index for 1-leg hop distance. Patients were divided into the following 4 groups according to their preoperative QSI: >80% (Excellent group), 80% to 60% (Good group), 60% to 40% (Moderate group), and ≤40% (Poor group). Main outcome measures: Postoperative QSI at 3, 6, and 12 months and 1-leg hop performance at 12 months after the surgery. Results: The Excellent group had the highest postoperative QSI at all periods. Based on the 1-leg hop performance, the Poor group had the lowest limb symmetry index and significantly greater anxiety during jump performance in comparison with the Excellent and Good groups. Conclusion: The present study shows a longitudinal recovery process and the average postoperative quadriceps strength after ACLR with hamstring autograft in patient groups stratified by preoperative QSI. The results indicate that the difference in preoperative QSI affects not only the longitudinal postoperative QSI recovery but also high-level 1-leg hop performance after ACLR using hamstring autograft.

PURPOSE: To analyze the long‐term evaluation of clinical, functional, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results after implant‐free press‐fit anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with bone‐patella tendon (BPT) versus quadrupled hamstring tendon (HT) grafts. METHODS: Sixty‐two ACL‐insufficient patients were included in a prospective, randomized study (31 BPT and 31 HT). Both surgical procedures were performed without any implants by a press‐fit technique by the senior author. The femoral tunnel was drilled through the anteromedial portal for anatomic placement. At 8.8 years after reconstruction, 53 patients (28 BPT and 25 HT) were examined by different clinical and functional tests. Bilateral MRI scans were performed and interpreted by an independent radiologist. RESULTS: On follow‐up, the score on the International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation form was significantly better in the HT group. The clinical examination including range of motion, KT‐1000 test (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), and pivot‐shift test showed no significant differences. On isokinetic testing, the mean quadriceps strength was close to normal (96%) in both groups, but the hamstring strength was lower in the HT group (100.3%/95.1%). Kneeling (1.5/1.1, P = .002), knee walking (1.72/1.14, P = .002), and single‐leg hop test (95.8%/99.1%, P = .057) were better in the HT group. The MRI findings about the mean degree of cartilage lesion (International Cartilage Repair Society protocol) of the operated (2.1/2.1) and nonoperated (1.4/1.8) knee showed no significant differences. No significant difference was found in the grade of medial or lateral meniscal lesion or the number of patients having meniscal lesions when the operated and nonoperated knees were compared. Tunnel measurements, Caton‐Deschamps Index, and the sagittal ACL angle were similar. CONCLUSIONS: The implant‐free press‐fit technique for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by use of bone‐patellar tendon and hamstring grafts with anatomic graft placement is an innovative technique to preserve the cartilage and meniscal status without significant differences between the operated and nonoperated knees in the long term. Significantly less anterior knee pain was noted in the hamstring group, when testing for kneeling and knee walking. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prospective comparative study.

Background: Current practice patterns for the management of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury favor surgical reconstruction. However, long-term outcomes may not differ between patients completing operative and nonoperative treatment of ACL injury. Differences in outcomes between operative and nonoperative treatment of patients in the United States is largely unknown, as are outcomes in long-term strength and performance measures. Purpose: To determine if differences exist in 5-year functional and radiographic outcomes between patients completing operative and nonoperative treatment of ACL injury when both groups complete a progressive criterion-based rehabilitation protocol. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: From an original group of 144 athletes, 105 participants (mean ± SD age, 34.3 ± 11.4 years) with an acute ACL rupture completed functional testing (quadriceps strength, single-legged hop, and knee joint effusion testing; patient-reported outcomes) and knee radiographs 5 years after ACL reconstruction or completion of nonoperative rehabilitation. Results: At 5 years, patients treated with ACL reconstruction versus rehabilitation alone did not differ in quadriceps strength (P = .817); performance on single-legged hop tests (P = .234-.955); activity level (P = .349-.400); subjective reports of pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, and knee-related quality of life (P = .090-.941); or presence of knee osteoarthritis (P = .102-.978). When compared with patients treated nonoperatively, patients treated operatively did report greater global ratings of knee function (P = .001), and lower fear (P = .035) at 5 years but were more likely to possess knee joint effusion (P = .016). Conclusion: The current findings indicate that favorable outcomes can occur after both operative and nonoperative management approaches with the use of progressive criterion-based rehabilitation. Further study is needed to determine clinical algorithms for identifying the best candidates for surgical versus nonoperative care after ACL injury. These findings provide an opportunity to improve the educational process between patients and clinicians regarding the expected clinical course and long-term outcomes of operative and nonoperative treatment of ACL injuries.

Purpose: The purpose of the current prospective study was to assess the changes over time in patients tested at 6 months and 9 months after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with a return to sport (RTS) test battery. It was hypothesized that more patients passed RTS criteria at 9 months compared to 6 months.Methods: Sixty-two ACLR patients performed a test battery at an average of 6.5 ± 0.7 and 9.5 ± 0.9 months after ACLR. All patients underwent a standardized rehabilitation protocol. The test battery consisted of the following tests: a jump-landing task assessed with the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS), three single-leg hop tasks (single-leg hop test, triple-leg hop test, side hop test), isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring strength at 60, 180 and 300°/s and two questionnaires (IKDC and ACL-RSI). Cut off criteria were set as Limb Symmetry Index (LSI) > 90% (for isokinetic strength and for single-leg hop tasks), LESS < 5, IKDC score within 15th percentage of healthy subjects and ACL-RSI > 56 respectively.Results: At 6 months, two patients (3.2%) passed all criteria. At 9 months, seven patients (11.3%) passed all criteria. Patients improved in all RTS criteria over time except for the IKDC score. Twenty-nine patients (46.8%) did not pass the strength criterion at 60°/s at 9 months after ACLR.Conclusions: The percentages of patients passing all RTS criteria were low at both 6 and 9 months after ACLR. Quadriceps strength revealed persistent deficits and the lack of improvement in the IKDC score questionnaires shows insufficient self-reported knee function for RTS.Level Of Evidence: III.

Purpose: There is a lack of objective factors which can be used in guiding the return to sport (RTS) decision after an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The purpose of the current study was to conduct qualitative analysis of the single leg hop (SLH) in patients after ACLR with a simple and clinical friendly method and to compare the possible difference in movement pattern between male and female patients.Methods: Sixty-five patients performed the single leg hop (SLH) test at 6.8 ± 1.0 months following isolated ACLR. Digital video camcorders recorded frontal and sagittal plane views of the patient performing the SLH. Knee flexion at initial contact (IC), peak knee flexion, knee flexion range of motion (RoM), and knee valgus RoM were calculated. In addition, limb symmetry index (LSI) scores were calculated.Results: No differences were found in movement pattern between males and females. Movement analysis revealed that males had a decrease in knee flexion at IC (p = 0.018), peak knee flexion (p = 0.002), and knee flexion RoM (p = 0.017) in the injured leg compared to the non-injured leg. Females demonstrated a decrease in peak knee flexion (p = 0.011) and knee flexion RoM (p = 0.023) in the injured leg compared to the non-injured leg. Average LSI scores were 92.4% for males and 94.5% for females.Conclusions: Although LSI scores were > 90%, clinical relevant altered movement patterns were detected in the injured leg compared to the non-injured leg. Caution is warranted to solely rely on LSI scores to determine RTS readiness.Clinical Trial Registry Name and Registration: The University of Groningen, ID 2012.362.Level Of Evidence: III.

Background: A limited number of patients return to sport (RTS) after an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and patients who RTS have a relatively high risk for second ACL injury. The purpose of the current study was to compare the results of a test battery between patients who returned to the pre-injury level of sport (RTS group) and patients who did not (NO-RTS group). It was hypothesized that the RTS group showed better test results. Method(s): Sixty-four patients (age 27.8 +/- 8.8 years) were included. The results of a multicomponent test battery (jump-landing task assessed with the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS), three hop tests, isokinetic strength test for quadriceps and hamstring) were compared between groups with a 2 x 2 ANOVA. Result(s): The RTS group showed a significantly lower LESS score (p = 0.010), significantly higher absolute scores on hop tests with both legs (injured leg: single leg hop test p = 0.013, triple leg hop test p = 0.024, side hop test p = 0.021; non-injured leg: single leg hop test p = 0.011, triple leg hop test p = 0.023, side hop test p = 0.032) and significantly greater hamstring strength in the injured leg (p = 0.009 at 60degree/s, p = 0.012 at 180degree/s and p = 0.013 at 300degree/s). No differences in test results were identified between patients who sustained a second ACL injury and patients who did not. Conclusion(s): Patients after ACLR with better jump-landing patterns, hop performance and greater hamstring strength have greater likelihood for RTS. However, our findings show that RTS criteria fail to identify patients who are at risk for a second ACL injury.Copyright © 2020 The Authors

OBJECTIVES: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are a common finding in sports medicine. Our scope is to investigate whether stable, incomplete medial meniscus tears could be left untreated during single bundle anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective observational study on 597 knees from a single surgeon cohort, using the same reconstruction technique, found 23 medial and 48 lateral meniscus tears which could be left untreated., RESULTS: None of the cases required reintervention during the first postoperative year. In fact, 21.7% of the medial meniscus group and 14.6% of the lateral group had potential residual symptoms that were not confirmed and gradually disappeared within one year. A comparison of Cincinnati Knee, IKDC scores and limb symmetry index values (calculated using the triple hop for distance into the two groups) found no differences for the last two variables (both p = 0.065) and was marginal for the first score (p < 0.05). The between groups comparisons, performed in the KT-1000, also yielded no difference (p = 0.11)., CONCLUSIONS: We than concluded that incomplete meniscal tears, left in situ at the time of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, could have favorable outcomes as long as decisions are carefully weighed with regard to the length of the lesion. Also, at least in this perspective, anatomic single bundle has proved a sufficient stabilizer for anterior translation of the tibia.

PURPOSE: The study was designed to compare the clinical results of traditional single‐bundle (SB) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with those of double‐bundle (DB) ACL reconstruction. METHODS: This study comprised 80 patients aged 18 to 45 years with an isolated ACL lesion: 40 patients underwent SB reconstruction, and 40 patients underwent DB reconstruction. Patients were assessed preoperatively with functional assessment including the International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 knee subjective form and visual analog scale, as well as physical examination (including the pivot‐shift test and instrumented knee laxity measurement). Vertical jump assessment with the Optojump system (Microgate, Bolzano, Italy) has been introduced as a method to compare functional ability between the 2 surgical techniques. The same protocol was repeated 6 months, 12 months, and 2 years after surgery. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were noted between the groups concerning subjective evaluation, thigh girth difference, mean visual analog scale score, range of motion, and Lachman and anterior drawer tests (P = not significant). A statistically higher number of patients in the SB group showed a positive pivot‐shift test and a higher side‐to‐side difference when measured with the KT‐1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA) than in the DB group (P < .001). Better mean jumping performance results were reported in the DB group compared with the SB group (P < .001). The average performance results for the injured limb were not significantly reduced compared with those of the uninjured limb in the DB group 12 months after surgery. At 2 years, a restoration of jumping ability in the ACL‐reconstructed limb was achieved in both groups regardless of the technique used. CONCLUSIONS: DB ACL reconstruction has been proven to be superior to the SB technique with regard to knee stability and vertical jump performance. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prospective comparative study.

Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury has a significant psychological effect, and a negative psychological state is a commonly cited reason for a reduction or cessation of sports participation after ACL reconstruction (ACLR) surgery. Purpose: To identify factors that contribute to an athlete’s psychological readiness to return to sport (RTS) after ACLR. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A cohort of 635 athletes (389 male, 246 female) who underwent ACLR and had been cleared to RTS completed the Anterior Cruciate Ligament–Return to Sport After Injury (ACL-RSI) scale at an average 12 months (range, 11-24 months) after surgery. Demographics (age, sex), sporting outcomes (preinjury frequency), surgical timing (injury to surgery interval), clinical factors (laxity), functional measures (single-limb hop symmetry), and symptoms of pain and function (International Knee Documentation Committee subjective) were also taken, and univariate and multiple regression models were used to determine the association between these and the psychological readiness of the athlete to RTS (ACL-RSI scores). Data for the entire cohort were initially analyzed; then, patients were grouped according to whether they had returned to competitive sport, and the analysis repeated for each group (return/nonreturn). Results: Univariate analysis for the entire group showed that all of the following had a positive effect on psychological readiness: male sex (β = 5.8; 95% CI, 2-10), younger age (β = −0.2; 95% CI, –0.4 to 0.01), a shorter interval between injury and surgery (β = −0.1; 95% CI, −0.1 to −0.02), a higher frequency of preinjury sport participation (β = 5.4; 95% CI, 2-9), greater limb symmetry (β = 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.6), and higher subjective knee scores (β = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.4). In the multivariate model, subjective knee scores and age significantly accounted for 37% of the variance in psychological readiness (r2 = 0.37, P < .0001). The only difference between the groups who had and had not returned to sport was that female sex was a significant contributor for the nonreturn group. Conclusion: Self-reported symptoms and function were most associated with psychological readiness to RTS after ACLR surgery. Male patients who participated frequently in sport before ACL injury had higher psychological readiness. Conversely, female patients had a more negative outlook and may therefore benefit more from interventions designed to facilitate a smooth transition back to sport.

Background: There is some evidence that functional performance and validated outcome scores differ according to the gender, age, and sport participation status of a patient after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. However, the impact of these three factors, and interaction among them, has not been studied across a large relatively homogeneous group of patients to better elucidate their impact.Questions/purposes: We reviewed a large cohort of patients who had undergone ACL reconstruction to determine if ROM, knee laxity, objective performance measures, and validated outcome scores differed according to (1) gender; (2) age; and (3) sport participation status.Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. Between 2007 and 2016, we performed 3452 single-bundle ACL reconstructions in patients who participated in sport before ACL injury. Of those, complete followup (including preoperative scores and scores at 1 year after surgery; mean, 14 months; range, 12-20 months) was available on 2672 (77%) of patients. Those lost to followup and those accounted for were not different in terms of age, gender, and sports participation at baseline. The study group consisted of 1726 (65%) men and 946 (35%) women with a mean ± SD age of 28 ± 10 years. For these patients, the following measures were obtained: knee ROM (flexion and extension deficit), instrumented knee laxity, single and triple hop for distance limb symmetry index (LSI), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective evaluation, and Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score. Mean scores and measures of variability were calculated for each outcome measure. Comparisons were made among gender, age, and sport status.Results: Men had less knee laxity after reconstruction (men 1.1 ± 2.2 mm, women 1.3 ± 2.4 mm; mean difference 0.2 mm [0.1-0.4], p < 0.001), greater limb symmetry (single limb hop men: 94% ± 12%, women 91% ± 13%, mean difference 3% [2%-4%], p < 0.001), and higher IKDC scores than did women (men 84 ± 12, women 82 ± 12, mean difference 2 [1-3], p < 0.001). With the exception of instrumented laxity, all outcome measures showed reduced deficits and higher scores in younger patients. This was most marked for LSI scores between the youngest and oldest aged patient groups (crossover hop: < 16 years 99% ± 10%, > 45 years 90% ± 16%, mean difference: 9 [5-11], p < 0.001). Patients who had returned to their preinjury sport also scored higher and had smaller deficits for all outcomes except ROM compared with patients who had not returned to sport at the time of followup (IKDC subjective: returned 90 ± 9, no sport 79 ± 12, mean difference 11 points [9-12], p < 0.001; single limb hop: returned 97 ± 10, no sport 91 ± 14, mean difference 6% [5%-7%], p < 0.001).Conclusions: This study showed that some of the most commonly used functional performance and validated clinical scores for ACL reconstruction are superior for patients who are younger, male, and have returned to preinjury sport. Reference to these data allows clinicians to more effectively evaluate a patient based on their age, gender, and sport status when making return to sport and rehabilitation decisions.Level Of Evidence: Level III, therapeutic study.

Purpose: The purpose of this prospective study was to describe the variability in leg muscle power and hop performance up to 2 years among patients following ACL reconstruction and specifically to illustrate the effects of various criteria for an acceptable level of muscle function.Methods: Eighty-two patients (56 men and 26 women)with a mean age of 28 years, who underwent ACL reconstruction using either hamstring tendons (n = 46) or a patellar tendon (n = 36), were assessed pre-operatively and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-surgery with a battery of three lower extremity muscle power tests and a battery of three hop tests.Results: Leg symmetry index (LSI) values at group level ranged between 73 and 100% at all follow-ups. When the tests were evaluated individually, patients reached an average LSI of ≥ 90% at 24 months. The success rate at 24 months for the muscle power test battery, that is,patients with an LSI of ≥ 90% in all three tests, was 48 and 44% for the hop test battery. The success rate at 24 months for both test batteries on all six muscle function tests was 22%. The criterion of an LSI of ≥ 80% resulted in 53% of the patients having an acceptable level on all six tests,while with a criterion of an LSI of ≥ 100%, none of the patients reached an acceptable level.Conclusion: At group level and in single muscle function tests, the muscle function outcome 1 and 2 years after ACL reconstruction is satisfactory in the present study and on a par with the results presented in the literature. However,when using more demanding criteria for a successful muscle function outcome, using batteries of tests or increasing the acceptable LSI level from ≥ 90% to ≥ 95%or ≥ 100%, the results are considered to be poor. It is suggested that this should be taken into consideration when presenting results after ACL rehabilitation, deciding on the criteria for a safe return to sports, or designing rehabilitation programmes after ACL reconstruction.Level Of Evidence: Prognostic prospective cohort study, Level I.

BACKGROUND: During the past decade, the use of biodegradable implants in anterior cruciate ligament surgery has increased. HYPOTHESIS: Poly‐L‐lactide acid (PLLA) interference screws would render the same clinical results but greater tunnel enlargement than metal screws 8 years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using hamstring tendon (semitendinosus/gracilis) autografts. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: A randomized series of 77 patients, all with a unilateral anterior cruciate ligament rupture, were divided into 2 groups (PLLA and metal). In both groups, hamstring tendon autografts were used with interference screw fixation at both ends and the patients were examined with standard radiographs, Tegner activity level, Lysholm knee score, single‐legged hop test, early C‐reactive protein response, and KT‐1000 arthrometer knee laxity measurements. RESULTS: The preoperative assessments in both groups were similar in terms of gender, clinical tests, and the time from injury to surgery. The patients returned for a radiographic and clinical examination a mean of 96 months (range, 78‐120 months) after the index operation. The PLLA group displayed significantly larger bone tunnels on the radiographs than the metal group on the femoral side (mean, 11.4 mm [range, 0‐17.8 mm] vs 8.0 mm [range, 0‐16.3 mm]; P < .005) but not on the tibial side (mean, 10.7 mm [range, 7.8‐14.1 mm] vs 10.5 mm [range, 0‐20.3 mm]; difference not significant). At follow‐up, no significant differences were found between the PLLA and metal groups in terms of knee laxity measurements (median, 1.0 mm [range, ‐2.0‐4.0 mm] vs 1.0 mm [range, ‐3.0‐6.5 mm]), Tegner activity level (median, 7 [range,3‐9] vs 6 [range, 2‐9]), or the Lysholm knee score (median, 90 points [range, 51‐100] vs 89 points [range, 53‐100]). The C‐reactive protein values did not differ significantly between the 2 groups except for an increase in the PLLA group compared with the metal group at day 1 postoperatively‐23 mg/L (range, <6‐55) vs 9 mg/L (range, <6‐55) (P < .001). CONCLUSION: There were significantly larger radiographically visible bone tunnels on the femoral side but not on the tibial side in the PLLA group compared with the metal group 8 years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using hamstring tendon autografts. This finding did not correlate with inferior clinical results. Because of the results in the present study, the authors have discontinued the use of PLLA interference screws.

Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate functional and patient self-reported outcomes six months after anterior cruciate ligament knee reconstruction using hamstring tendons. Methods: Sixty-five healthy subjects, which they had standardized operation and post-operation physiotherapy were included in the study. We measured isokinetic strength, dynamic postural stability, anterior-posterior knee laxity measurements and one-legged hop test. For patient-self reported outcomes we used Lysholm and Tegner questionnares. Results: Average deficit muscles peak torques were slightly higher than normal values, except for flexor muscles, where we found no significant difference at 240 °/sec. We found no significant difference between operated and nonoperated knee for the manual maximum testing, stabillity index and hop index. Mean Lysholm score was very good (94%) and Tegner score was 6 points. Conclusion: Functional outcomes were comparable with normative values or to those of opposite knees, except for muscle strength testing. 44.6% of all patients have returned to the preinjury Tegner activity level.

BACKGROUND: Creatine supplementation has been shown to augment training‐induced strength gains. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of creatine supplementation on recovery of muscle strength after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. HYPOTHESIS: Creatine supplementation will facilitate strength gains after ACL reconstruction. STUDY DESIGN: Double‐blind, prospective, and randomized clinical trial. METHODS: Sixty patients were randomized into creatine or placebo groups. Quadriceps and hamstring strength and power were measured isokinetically. Hip flexor, abductor, and adductor strengths were measured with a handheld dynamometer prior to surgery and at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, or 6 months after surgery. RESULTS: From 6 weeks to 12 weeks after surgery, there were significant increases in strength on the involved side for knee extension (47%), knee flexion (27%), hip flexion (20%), hip abduction (9%), and hip adduction (17%). These strength improvements were unaffected by creatine supplementation with similar effects in the creatine and placebo groups. From 6 weeks to 12 weeks after surgery, there were significant increases in power on the involved side for knee extension (46%) and knee flexion (26%), but these effects were not affected by creatine supplementation. At 6 months, creatine supplementation did not affect outcome as measured by the single leg hop test for distance or the knee outcome score. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that patients do not benefit from creatine supplementation during the first 12 weeks of rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction.

Purpose: To determine clinical and neuromuscular properties in patients with normal or sub-normal subjective knee function after finalisation of 6 months' post-operative rehabilitation following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Method(s): Sixty patients after primary anatomical single-bundle hamstring ACLR were prospectively enrolled. Demographics, subjective, clinical and functional status of the injured knee were recorded at baseline, 6 and 12 months post-operatively. Return to pre-injury activities time (months) was monitored. Tensiomyography and isokinetic dynamometry of thigh muscles were performed at 6 months, when standard ACLR rehabilitation is finalized. Based on their IKDC Subjective Knee Evaluation scores at 6 months, they were assigned into "Normal" or "Sub-normal" group. All the above measured parameters were then compared between the two groups. Result(s): At 6 months' timeline, 21 patients (35%) perceived their knee function as "Normal", while 39 (65%) were "Sub-normal". There were no differences in clinical status between both groups, but patients in Normal group achieved higher IKDC, Lysholm, Tegner scores as well as higher single-leg hop test. They were taller, had lower body mass index and more of them achieved their preinjury level of activity at 12 months (67% vs. 33%). Tensiomyography revealed higher biceps femoris as well as semitendinosus and semimembranosus radial displacement values on the operated leg in Normal group. Isokinetic dynamometry showed significantly higher normalised peak torque and average power of knee extensor muscles. Conclusion(s): Patients who perceive their knee function as normal at 6 months following ACLR presented with better neuromuscular properties of the thigh muscles. Decreased hamstring stiffness seems to be the key to higher return-to-preinjury activity. Postoperative rehabilitation should be more focused on reducing hamstring stiffness in addition to improving knee extensor muscle strength.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the differences in patient-reported outcome measures, isokinetic strength, plyometric ability and ability to meet return to play criteria ten months after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery between those who underwent meniscectomy, those who underwent meniscal repair and those with no meniscal intervention alongside ACL reconstruction surgery., METHODS: Three hundred and thirteen athletes with clinically and radiologically confirmed ACL ruptures were included in this study. Participants were grouped according to their intra-operative procedures (isolated ACL reconstruction surgery n = 155, ACL reconstruction surgery with meniscectomy n = 128, ACL reconstruction surgery with meniscal repair n = 30). Participants completed patient-reported outcome measures questionnaires (Marx Activity Rating Scale, the ACL Return to Sport after Injury and the International Knee Documentation Committee Score) and completed a battery of objective functional testing including isokinetic dynamometry and jump performance testing (countermovement jump and drop jump) between 9 and 11 months after surgery., RESULTS: No significant between-group differences were identified in any metric relating to patient-reported outcome measures (p = .611), strength and jump measures (p = .411) or the ability to achieve symmetry-based return to play criteria (p = .575)., CONCLUSIONS: Clinically, these results suggest that concomitant meniscal surgery has no significant effects on patient-reported outcome measures, strength and jump metrics at the return to play stage post-operatively and can inform the pre-operative counselling of those awaiting ACL reconstruction surgery with likely meniscal intervention.

Background: Meniscal injuries are commonly associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. Treatment of meniscal injuries can impart delayed weightbearing and range of motion restrictions, which can affect the rehabilitation protocol. The effect of meniscal treatment and subsequent restrictions on strength recovery after ACL reconstruction is unclear. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to compare strength, jumping performance, and patient-reported outcomes between patients who underwent isolated ACL reconstruction (ACLR) and those who underwent surgical intervention for meniscal pathology at the time of ACLR. Our hypothesis was that patients who underwent concurrent meniscal repair (MR) would have lower strength recovery owing to postoperative restrictions. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Method(s): Patients with ACLR were stratified into isolated ACLR, ACLR and meniscectomy (ACLR-MS), or ACLR-MR groups and were compared with healthy controls. The ACLR-MR group was restricted to partial weightbearing and to 90degree of knee flexion for the first 6 weeks postoperatively. All participants completed patient-reported outcomes (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]) and underwent bilateral isokinetic and isometric strength tests of the knee extensor and flexor groups as part of a return-to-sports test battery at 5 to 7 months postoperatively. Result(s): A total of 165 patients with ACLR (50 with isolated ACLR, 44 with ACLR-MS, and 71 with ACLR-MR) and 140 healthy controls were included in the study. Follow-up occurred at a mean of 5.96 +/- 0.47 months postoperatively. The control group demonstrated higher subjective knee function, unilateral peak extensor torque, and limb symmetry than did the ACLR-MS and ACLR-MR groups combined (P <.001 for all). There were no differences in IKDC, KOOS subscales, or unilateral or limb symmetry measures of peak knee extensor or flexor torque among the isolated ACLR, ACLR-MS, and ACLR-MR groups. Conclusion(s): Persistent weakness, asymmetry, and reduced subjective outcome scores at 6-month follow-up after ACLR were not influenced by meniscal treatment. These findings suggested that the weightbearing and range of motion restrictions associated with meniscal repair recovery do not result in loss of early strength or worse patient-reported outcomes.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

CONTEXT: The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Evaluation is the most frequently used patient-reported measure of subjective knee function among individuals with ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Yet, limitations with traditional validation approaches leave it unclear whether the IKDC measures knee function as intended. Rasch analysis offers a robust validation approach, which may enhance clinical interpretation of the IKDC. OBJECTIVE(S): 1) To assess the psychometric properties, 2) ability to classify health status, and 3) relationships between the IKDC and objective measures of strength and functional performance relative to a newly proposed reduced-item instrument. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-seven individuals with primary, unilateral ACLR (21.9+/-7.8 years, 6.2+/-1.0 months post-surgery), and seventy-six age-matched controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Rasch analysis was used to assess the psychometric properties of the IKDC. Receiver-operator-characteristic curves and logistic regression were used to assess the accuracy of classifying ACLR versus control participants. Correlations (Pearson and Spearman) were used to assess relationships between subjective knee function, quadriceps torque, and single-limb hop performance. RESULT(S): Rasch analysis aided the development of a reduced 8-item instrument (IKDC-8), which yielded improved psychometric properties in misfit analysis, percent of variance accounted for by one dimension (IKDC-8=71.5%; IKDC=56.7%), and item reliability. The IKDC was an outstanding diagnostic tool and the IKDC-8 was excellent, correctly classifying 87.2% and 82.7% of cases, respectively. The Hanley-McNeil formula found that there was no significant difference in the areas under the respective ROC curves. Equivalent associations between subjective and objective knee function were observed regardless of instrument used. CONCLUSION(S): We observed evidence of enhanced reliability and validity for a parsimonious measure of subjective knee function. The proposed instrument reduces the number of items, increases score interpretability as measuring a single construct, and improves the rating scale functioning, while not significantly diminishing its ability to classify ACLR versus control participants or changing existing relationships with objective measures of recovery. We suggest the IKDC-8 may enhance clinical use by reducing administration time, improving the interpretation of the subjective knee function score, and clarifying functional ability.Copyright © by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc.

Background Hop tests are commonly employed to evaluate functional limb symmetry after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Purpose To investigate the ability of eight hop tests to identify functional limb asymmetry in patients after ACLR. Study Design Prospective cohort. Methods Fifty patients were assessed 9-12 months following ACLR. Functional performance on both the operated and non-operated limb was assessed via eight hop tests, assessed in a randomised order. These included the: single (SHD), triple (THD) and triple crossover (TCHD) hop for distance, 6m timed hop (6MTH), single medial (MHD) and single lateral (LHD) hop for distance, single countermovement jump (SLCMJ) and timed speedy hop (TSHT). Differences in Limb Symmetry Indices (LSIs) across hop tests were compared, while Pearson's correlations were undertaken to investigate the significance and strength of the association between hop test LSIs. Results Significant differences were observed across hop LSIs (p<0.0001). Mean LSIs for the SHD (95.0%), 6MTH (95.0%), THD (96.1%) and TCHD (95.3%) were ≥90% and significantly greater (p<0.05) than the MHD (87.3%), LHD (87.5%), SLCMJ (83.4%) and TSHT (86.5%), which were all <90%. The LSI for the SLCMJ was significantly lower (p<0.05) than all other hop tests. While significant correlations existed across the majority of hop LSIs, the strongest correlations existed between the SHD, THD and TCHD (r=0.70-0.80), and lowest correlations between the TSHT and the other hop tests (r=0.26-0.49). Conclusions The LHD, MHD and TSHT, as well as the SLCMJ in particular, were best able to demonstrate functional limb asymmetry in patients following ACLR. These hop measures should be incorporated into hop test batteries, if the purpose is to detect the presence of lingering functional deficits. Level of Evidence Level 3. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

BACKGROUND: The risk of a second anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury when participating in pivoting sports after ACL reconstruction is high. Risk factors associated with a second ACL injury are complex., PURPOSE: To investigate the combinations of various clinical risk factors associated with second ACL injury in female soccer players with a primary unilateral ACL reconstruction, using Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis., STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2., METHODS: A total of 117 active female soccer players (mean +/- SD age, 20 +/- 2 years) were included. Athletes were enrolled 19 +/- 9 months after ACL reconstruction and were prospectively followed for 2 years. At baseline, all players underwent assessment of knee and ankle joint range of motion (ROM), participated in functional tests (postural control, hop performance, and movement asymmetries in the lower limbs and trunk), and answered questionnaires (patient-reported knee function, knee-related quality of life, psychological and personality factors). A clinical prediction model using CART was developed., RESULTS: A total of 28 players (24%) sustained a second ACL injury (21 ipsilateral and 7 contralateral ruptures) while playing soccer. CART analysis selected 9 of 19 independent variables associated with second ACL injury: the 5-jump test, knee collapse on the non-ACL reconstructed leg in a drop vertical jump, tuck jump, limb symmetry index on side hop and the single hop for distance, side difference in ankle dorsiflexion ROM, and scores for the questionnaires ACL-Return to Sport After Injury and the Swedish Universities Scales of Personality subscales of Stress Susceptibility and Adventure Seeking. The accuracy of the model was 89%, with 100% sensitivity and 76% specificity. CART analysis indicated that the interaction of longer jumps in the 5-jump test (>916 cm) with more side difference in ankle dorsiflexion ROM (>-2.5degree) and more knee valgus collapse in the nonreconstructed knee (>-1.4 cm) (relative risk, 4.03; 95% CI, 2.21-7.36) best predicted an increased likelihood of a second ACL injury., CONCLUSION: The risk profiles selected by CART could accurately identify female soccer players at high risk for a second ACL injury. There was an interaction between functional performance, clinical assessment, and psychological factors, and it is reasonable to include these factors in return-to-sport decisions and in athlete screening after ACL injury.

BACKGROUND: Athletes are twice as likely to rupture the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) on their healthy contralateral knee than the reconstructed graft after ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Although physical testing is commonly used after ACLR to assess injury risk to the operated knee, strength, jump, and change-of-direction performance and biomechanical measures have not been examined in those who go on to experience a contralateral ACL injury, to identify factors that may be associated with injury risk., PURPOSE: To prospectively examine differences in biomechanical and clinical performance measures in male athletes 9 months after ACLR between those who ruptured their previously uninjured contralateral ACL and those who did not at 2-year follow-up and to examine the ability of these differences to predict contralateral ACL injury., STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3., METHODS: A cohort of male athletes returning to level 1 sports after ACLR (N = 1045) underwent isokinetic strength testing and 3-dimensional biomechanical analysis of jump and change-of-direction tests 9 months after surgery. Participants were followed up at 2 years regarding return to play or at second ACL injury. Between-group differences were analyzed in patient-reported outcomes, performance measures, and 3-dimensional biomechanics for the contralateral limb and asymmetry. Logistic regression was applied to determine the ability of identified differences to predict contralateral ACL injury., RESULTS: Of the cohort, 993 had follow-up at 2 years (95%), with 67 experiencing a contralateral ACL injury and 38 an ipsilateral injury. Male athletes who had a contralateral ACL injury had lower quadriceps strength and biomechanical differences on the contralateral limb during double- and single-leg drop jump tests as compared with those who did not experience an injury. Differences were related primarily to deficits in sagittal plane mechanics and plyometric ability on the contralateral side. These variables could explain group membership with fair to good ability (area under the curve, 0.74-0.80). Patient-reported outcomes, limb symmetry of clinical performance measures, and biomechanical measures in change-of-direction tasks did not differentiate those at risk for contralateral injury., CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of sagittal plane control during drop jump tasks and the limited utility of limb symmetry in performance and biomechanical measures when assessing future contralateral ACL injury risk in male athletes. Targeting the identified differences in quadriceps strength and plyometric ability during late-stage rehabilitation and testing may reduce ACL injury risk in healthy limbs in male athletes playing level 1 sports., CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study highlights the importance of assessing the contralateral limb after ACLR and identifies biomechanical differences, particularly in the sagittal plane in drop jump tasks, that may be associated with injury to this limb. These factors could be targeted during assessment and rehabilitation with additional quadriceps strengthening and plyometric exercises after ACLR to potentially reduce the high risk of injury to the previously healthy knee., REGISTRATION: NCT02771548 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier).

Purpose: To investigate the relationship between single-leg hop distance (SLHD), normalized body height, and return-to-sports (RTS) status after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and to identify the cut-off value for SLHD on the operated side. Method(s): Seventy-three patients after primary ACLR (median 13.5 months) participated in this cross-sectional study. Participants were divided into ''Yes-RTS'' (YRTS) or ''No-RTS'' (NRTS) groups based on a self-reported questionnaire. SLHD was measured, and the limb symmetry index (LSI) and SLHD (%body height) were calculated. A minimum p-value approach was used to calculate the SLHD cut-off points (%body height) on the operated side that were strongly associated with the RTS status. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyse the association between RTS status and SLHD cut-off point (%body height). Isokinetic strength and Tampa scale for kinesiophobia (TSK) were measured as covariates. Result(s): Among 73 patients, 43 (59%) were assigned to the YRTS and 30 (41%) to the NRTS group. The 70% body height cut-off point for SLHD on the operated side was most strongly associated with RTS status. In a logistic regression analysis including other covariates, SLHD (%body height) < 70% and TSK were negatively associated with RTS status. Except for two participants, the LSI of the SLHD exceeded 90% and there was no significant association between the LSI of the SLHD and RTS status. Conclusion(s): Even after improvement in the LSI of the SLHD, planning rehabilitation with the goal of achieving SLHD over 70% body height may be important for supporting RTS after ACLR.

Background. Return to participation in sport is an important outcome when evaluating the success of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery. A review by Arden et al. (2014) demonstrates that just because an athlete has surgery, it does not automatically mean that they will return to sport. So, the purpose of this study was to assess if patients could return to their pre-injury activity level 8 months after ACLR. Methods. Patients completed IKDC-2000, ACL-RSI questionnaires, underwent FMS, YBT, HOP test sets and drop jump tests, which were evaluated with the LESS. ACL laxity was measured by using a GNRB® device. Participants were 81 patients. They were divided into two groups based on single leg HOP test results. The first group included 30 persons who all had their four single leg HOP test scores above 90%. The second group consisted of 51 persons for whom at least one of the single leg HOP tests scored lower than 90%. Results. IKDC and HOP test results in the first group scored higher than in the second group. Psychological confidence was higher in the first group, who had better HOP test results. For the first group, FMS and LESS results were better than those for the second group. Moderate positive correlation was found between LESS scores and laxity results, FMS, three HOP sub-tests. IKDC had the biggest number of correlations with other tests. Results showed negative and weak correlation with laxity results using 134 N power, as well as positive and moderate correlation with HOP sub-tests, FMS, ACL-RSI. Single HOP for distance, triple HOP for distance, crossover HOP for distance and LESS increased the odds of achieving RTS criteria. No other factors were found to be associated with the accomplishment of reaching RTS criteria after ACLR. Conclusions. The main factor which can help decide if a person can return to their pre-injury level of physical activity are the single leg HOP test and LESS. The use of single leg HOP tests and LESS along with psychological and self-reported evaluations is the best test combination for assessment 8 months after ACLR. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined patient satisfaction with playing pre-injury sports after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to investigate patient satisfaction with playing pre-injury sport and identify factors associated with satisfaction., METHODS: A total of 97 patients underwent unilateral ACL reconstruction using a hamstring autograft and returned to pre-injury sports 1 year after surgery. Patient satisfaction with playing pre-injury sport was assessed by a visual analog scale (VAS) and an ordinal four-grade scale. Problems related to the operated knee were also assessed. Knee muscle strength, single leg hop distance, knee laxity, subjective knee pain, and fear of movement/reinjury using Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia-11 (TSK-11) were measured. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with patient satisfaction with playing pre-injury sport 1 year after surgery., RESULTS: The average VAS score for patient satisfaction with playing pre-injury sports 1 year after surgery was 77.8 +/- 20.2. Of the 97 patients, 87 patients (89.7%) answered "satisfied" or "mostly satisfied", whereas 51 patients (52.6%) had one or more problems. Multivariate linear regression analysis identified that the TSK-11 score was associated with patient satisfaction with playing a pre-injury sport 1 year after surgery., CONCLUSION: Most of the patients who returned to pre-injury sports were satisfied with their outcomes. In contrast, approximately half of the patients had one or more problems after returning to play pre-injury sports. In particular, fear of movement/reinjury was significantly associated with patient satisfaction with playing pre-injury sport 1 year after surgery. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction is the current standard care of treatment for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Modified transtibial (mTT) and anteromedial portal (AMP) techniques aim at the anatomical placement of femoral tunnel. Controversy existed in the literature with regard to the outcome of these techniques. Hence, we designed a retrospective comparative study to analyse the clinical and functional outcomes of mTT and AMP techniques. We hypothesized that there would be no difference between the clinical and functional outcomes in mTT and AMP techniques. This retrospective observational study was conducted in consecutive patients who underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using semitendinosus-gracilis (STG) quadrupled graft in our tertiary care centre with a minimum follow-up of two years. Out of 69 patients, 37 had undergone ACL reconstruction by mTT technique and remaining by AMP technique. All the patients were assessed clinically by anterior drawer, Lachman's, pivot shift and single-legged hop test. Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation score were used for the functional status. Knee instability was assessed objectively by KT-1000 arthrometer. There was no statistically significant difference in baseline demographic characteristics between mTT and AMP groups. At the end of 2 years, no statistically significant difference was noted in the anterior drawer and Lachman's test. Though not significant, IKDC scores and Lysholm's scores showed a better outcome in the AMP group when compared to the mTT group. AMP group showed significantly better outcome with KT-1000 arthrometer. Based on the results obtained, we presume that overall both mTT and AMP have similar functional outcome. However, as AMP technique offers significantly improved subjective rotational stability on pivot shift test, better hop limb symmetry index and KT 1000 readings compared to mTT, we suggest AMP over mTT.Copyright © 2021.

Background: Information about specific factors of physical function that contribute to psychological readiness is needed to plan rehabilitation for a return to sports. The purpose of this study was to identify specific physical functions related to the psychological readiness of patients aiming to return to sports 6 months after reconstruction. We hypothesized that the knee strength is a factor related to the Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport after Injury scale (ACL-RSI) cutoff score for a return to sports. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional study. Fifty-four patients who had undergone primary reconstruction using hamstring tendon participated in this study. Psychological readiness was measured using the ACL-RSI in patients at 6 months after reconstruction. To identify specific physical functions related to the ACL-RSI score, participants were divided into groups with ACL-RSI scores of >= 60 or < 60. Non-paired t-tests or the Mann-Whitney test were performed to analyze group differences in objective variables in physical function: (1) knee strength in both legs; (2) leg anterior reach distance on both sides; and (3) single-leg hop (SLH) distances in three directions for both legs. Result(s): Significant differences between groups were identified in knee flexion strength (60degree/s) for the uninvolved limb, hamstring-to-quadriceps ratio (60degree/s) for the uninvolved limb, knee flexion strength (180degree/s) for the involved limb, limb symmetry index (LSI) of leg anterior reach distance, the ratio of the distance to the height of the patient and LSI of SLH distances in lateral and medial directions. Conclusion(s): This study revealed that at 6 months after reconstruction, increased knee flexion strength (ratio of peak torque measured to body mass of the patient), hamstring-to-quadriceps ratio, leg anterior reach distance LSI, and lateral and medial SLH appear important to exceed the ACL-RSI cutoff for a return to sports. The present results may be useful for planning post-operative rehabilitation for long-term return to sports after reconstruction.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).

Purpose: To determine whether the addition of an anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) resulted in delayed functional recovery (based on the Knee Santy Athletic Return to Sport [K-STARTS] score) at 6 months after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Method(s): A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from consecutive patients who underwent an ACLR between September 2017 and December 2020 was conducted. Patients who received an isolated hamstring autograft (isolated ACLR group) were propensity matched in a 1:1 ratio to patients who received a hamstring autograft ACLR combined with an ALLR (ACLR-ALLR group). Outcome measures included the Tegner Activity Scale and the K-STARTS test-a validated composite return-to-sports test (including the Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport After Injury scale, Qualitative Assessment of Single-Leg Landing tool, limb symmetry index, and ability to change direction using the Modified Illinois Change of Direction Test). Result(s): The study included 111 matched pairs. At 6 months postoperatively, there were no significant differences between groups in the overall K-STARTS score (65.4 for isolated ACLR vs 61.2 for ACLR-ALLR, P = .087) or the Tegner Activity Scale score (3.7 for isolated ACLR vs 3.8 for ACLR-ALLR, P = .45). In addition, an evaluation of the subscales of the K-STARTS score revealed no disadvantage across the domains of neuromuscular control, limb symmetry index, agility, or psychological readiness to return to sport when an ALLR was performed. Conclusion(s): The addition of ALLR at the time of ACLR does not delay functional recovery. Specifically, at 6 months postoperatively, there was no disadvantage in patients undergoing ALLR-ACLR, when compared with those undergoing isolated ACLR, with respect to neuromuscular control, limb symmetry indices (hop tests), agility, or psychological readiness to return to sport.

BACKGROUND: A paucity of information is available regarding the clinical outcomes of patients with radiological evidence of Kaplan fiber (KF) injury who undergo anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR)., PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose was to compare clinical and functional outcomes in patients undergoing acute primary ACLR with and without magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of KF injury. The hypothesis was that there would be no difference in clinical or functional outcomes in patients with versus those without radiological evidence of KF injury., STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3., METHODS: MRI analysis was conducted on patients in a longitudinal prospective study of ACL injury. Only patients who had an MRI scan and had undergone isolated primary ACLR within 60 days of injury were included. MRI was performed using standard knee protocols, and diagnostic criteria were applied to identify KF injury. A total of 32 patients with KF injury (mean age, 24.2 years; 21 male, 11 female) were identified and matched for sex, age, graft type, and preinjury activity with 90 patients who had intact KF. Patients were followed up at 12 months with KT-1000 arthrometer measurements of side-to-side difference in anterior knee laxity, single- and triple-hop limb symmetry index (LSI), Marx activity and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, and return to sport (RTS) rates at 12 months and 24 months., RESULTS: No differences were found in anterior knee laxity and single- and triple-hop LSI values between the KF-intact and KF-injured cohorts at 12 months. No differences in Marx and IKDC scores were found between the groups at 12 months and 2 years. The overall rate of RTS within 24 months was 75% (92/122), and 5 patients (2 KF-injured; 3 KF-intact) had a subsequent graft rupture., CONCLUSION: We found no difference in clinical or functional outcomes in patients with and without radiological evidence of KF injury who underwent acute primary ACLR. Based on these findings, the radiological presence of KF injury at the time of acute ACL injury should not be regarded as a risk factor for a negative prognosis after ACLR.

PURPOSE: To compare the clinical and radiological outcomes in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with, or without, LARS augmentation., METHODS: One-hundred and thirty-six patients that underwent double-bundle ACLR with (DB Hams/LARS, n = 67), or without (DB Hams, n = 69), LARS augmentation, were assessed clinically and with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at a minimum of 7-years post-surgery. Patients were assessed via patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), KT-1000 (laxity), isokinetic knee extensor and flexor strength and a 4-hop test battery. Limb symmetry indices (LSIs) were calculated. The Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS) evaluated knee status via MRI. Sport participation, secondary operations, ACL re-tears and contralateral ACL tears were reported., RESULTS: No differences (n.s.) were observed in demographics, PROMs, KT-1000 scores or strength and hop LSIs. Normal (< 3 mm side-to-side differences) KT-1000 scores were observed in 64 (92.8%) and 59 (88.1%) of DB Hams and DB Hams/LARS patients, respectively. Comparative rates of satisfaction were reported. Knee flexor strength and hop test LSIs were all >95% in both groups, which was 94.2% and 96.7% for knee extensor strength in the DB Hams and DB Hams/LARS cohorts, respectively. While 53 (76.8%) and 52 (77.6%) of the DB Hams and DB Hams/LARS patients had returned to pivoting sports, 42 (60.9%) and 41 (61.2%) were participating in pivoting sports at the minimum 7-year review. No difference (n.s.) was observed in the WORMS (12.3 DB Hams, 16.7 DB Hams/LARS). Of the cohort assessed, 8 (11%) DB Hams and 11 (16%) DB Hams/LARS patients had undergone secondary surgery. In addition to one patient in each group that demonstrated ACL rupture on MRI, an additional cohort of patients were excluded from the current analysis due to prior re-tear (DB Hams n = 6, DB Hams/LARS n = 8) or contralateral ACL tear (DB Hams n = 4, DB Hams/LARS n = 4)., CONCLUSIONS: Comparable outcomes were observed after double-bundle ACLR using autologous hamstrings with, or without, LARS augmentation. Therefore, while these outcomes do not justify the additional use of synthetic augmentation given the lack of further benefit and additional cost, higher rates of graft failure, synovitis and early osteoarthritic change previously reported were not observed., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.

Context: Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury is disabling in several sports because it causes knee instability and functional deficit. Usually, surgical treatments produce the best functional outcomes, however, sometimes they are not always able to fully restore stability and function. Objective(s): The objective of this study was to evaluate postural balance, muscle strength, and functional performance of young athletes with an ACL injury before and after ACL reconstruction. Design(s): This was a longitudinal observational prospective study. Method(s): 74 athletes, 60 men, and 14 women, aged between 16 and 45, divided into two groups: the Group-Lesion of ACL with 34 athletes (24.1 years) and the Group-Control with 40 athletes without ACL lesion (27.7 years old). All volunteers performed posturography, isokinetic dynamometry, and the Hop-Test. The ACL-Group was evaluated before and 12 months after the reconstruction and the control group was evaluated once. Result(s): The Postoperative ACL Group presented greater limb symmetry, 0.96 (+/- 0.12), than the preoperative ACL Group, 0.87 (+/- 0.17), p < 0.01 in the Hop-Test. In the posturography, the displacement area was smaller in the postoperative ACL Group, 19.85 (+/- 5.74), compared to the preoperative ACL Group, 24.20 (+/- 8.97), p < 0.01. In isokinetic dynamometry the torque peak was greater in the postoperative ACL Group, 0.91 (+/- 0.14), than in the preoperative ACL Group, 0.74 (+/- 0.15), p < 0.01. Conclusion(s): The functional outcomes increased in ACL reconstruction athletes after 12 months, but not at the same level as in the Control Group. The result indicates an incomplete functional recovery, adaptive changes in postural control after injury, reconstruction, and return to sport.Copyright © 2022 HCFMUSP

Purpose: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is a common injury and psychological parameters measured at 6-8 months are said to be almost more predictive for return to sport (RTS) than physiological. Purpose was 1) to evaluate the correlation between knee apprehension using ACL-RSI and physical factors after ACL reconstruction (ACLR), 2) to assess the correlation between ACL-RSI and patient parameters (age, pivot-sport, BMI), and 3) to evaluate ACL-RSI over time. Method(s): Patients with ACLR with or without meniscal repair between 2013 and 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Including criteria were RTS testing battery, assessed at least 6 months after surgery, including physical parameters (strength, triple hop test, side hop test, and bilateral knee stability) and psychological parameters (ACL-RSI). 5 subgroups were analyzed to assessed factors such as age, BMI, pivot sport, time interval between two RTS testing battery. Result(s): Three hundred three patients (212 male, 91 female) presenting ACLR were included. Mean age at surgery was 27 (+/- 8) years. 258 patients practiced pivot-sport activity and 45 non-pivot-sport activity. The mean interval between ACL rupture and surgery was 6.5 (+/- 4.5) months. RTS testing battery were performed at 8 (+/- 7) months after ACLR. Mean ACL-RSI was 58 (+/- 28). 1) ACL-RSI was not influenced by muscle strength, coordination and stability of the knee. 2) ACL-RSI was significantly better in lower BMI and non-pivot-sport activities. No correlation was found between graft type, age, sex, and ACL-RSI assessment. 3) For patients who performed two RTS testing battery at 8 and 12 months, ACL-RSI did not significantly increase over time (56 to 64 points, p = 0.22) in spite of significant increased quadriceps (127 to 151 Nm/kg, p = 0.005) and hamstring (93 to 105 Nm/kg, p = 0.05) strength. Conclusion(s): Psychological readiness before RTS, measured upon ACL-RSI does not correlate with any physical parameter at 8-12 months postoperatively. Although quadriceps and hamstring strength increased significantly over time, ACL-RSI does not and must therefore be routinely assessed.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).

PURPOSE: To compare patient reported outcomes and functional knee recovery following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using either a quadriceps tendon (QT) or hamstring tendon (HT) autograft., METHODS: Thirty-five QT patients (age 20; range 15-34 years) participated in this study and were matched for gender, age and pre-injury activity level to 70 HT (age 20; range 15-32 years) patients. The following assessments were performed at 6 and 12 months post-operatively; standardized patient-reported outcome measures (IKDC, KOOS-QOL, ACL-RSI, Marx activity, anterior knee pain), knee range of motion (passive and active), anterior knee laxity, hop tests (single and triple crossover hop for distance), and isokinetic strength of the knee extensors and flexors. All dependent variables were analysed using a two-way mixed ANOVA model, with within (Time; 6 and 12 months) and between-subject (Graft; QT and HT) factors., RESULTS: Patient reported outcome measures and hop performance improved between 6 and 12 months (p < 0.001), however no significant differences in either patient-reported outcomes or hop performance were found between the two grafts. Isokinetic strength testing showed both groups improved their peak knee extensor strength in the operated limb between 6 and 12 months (p < 0.001), but the QT group had significantly lower knee extensor strength symmetry at both time points compared to HT at 60 deg/s (p < 0.001) and 180 deg/s (p < 0.01). In contrast, the QT group had significantly greater knee flexor strength symmetry at both time points compared to HT at 60 deg/s (p < 0.01) and 180 deg/s (p = 0.01), but knee flexor strength limb symmetry did not significantly improve over time in either group., CONCLUSION: Recovery of knee function following either QT or HT ACL reconstruction continues between 6 and 12 months after surgery. However, knee extensor strength deficits in the QT group and knee flexor strength deficits in the HT persisted at 12 months. This may have implications for decisions regarding return to sport., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III. Copyright © 2021. European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery, Arthroscopy (ESSKA).

Introduction Second anterior cruciate ligament (SACL) injuries are a devastating complication following return to sport (RTS). Appropriate and safe RTS criteria that reduce the risk of SACL injuries are needed. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between functional and isokinetic testing at 6 months following primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR) as risk factors for SACL injuries. Methods Patients with primary ACLR from 1990 to 2010 were identified. Those with 6-month postoperative functional and isokinetic testing and a minimum of 2-year follow-up were included. Functional testing included vertical jump, single-leg hop, and single-leg triple hop. Isokinetic testing included concentric quadriceps and hamstrings (HSs) strength at 60 and 180 degree/s speeds. Statistical analysis evaluated the significance of the various tests between those with and without a secondary tear. Results In total, 344 patients with a mean age of 26.0 +/- 9.8 years at an average time of 9.1 +/- 3.5 years of follow-up were analyzed. Fifty-nine patients (17%) experienced SACL injuries at an average time of 4.8 years following ACLR with 34 (58%) ipsilateral graft ruptures and 25 (43%) contralateral tears. Several isokinetic measures were significantly different between the NO SACL and the SACL groups: Quadriceps 60 degree/s limb symmetry index (LSI) (75 vs. 82% p = 0.01), HS 60 degree/s LSI (92 vs. 97%, p = 0.04), quadriceps 180 degree/s involved/body weight (BW) (41 vs. 47%, p = 0.04), and HS 180 degree/s involved/BW (30 vs. 34%, p = 0.04). Patients with involved limb peak quadriceps torque value greater than 65 or 50% of BW (60 and 180 degree/s) had a 2.2 and 3.1 times higher risk of an SACL injury. Conclusions Patients with certain elevated isokinetic scores in the injured limb at 6 months after ACLR experienced a higher rate of subsequent ACL injuries than those who had lower peak torque. Although a quantitative only analysis may not be sufficient to determine RTS criteria, clinicians should caution high-performing patients about the risk of subsequent ACL injury.

Purpose: To evaluate whether contralateral limb strength represents a dynamic, rather than static, data point after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R). Method(s): Patients who underwent isolated ACL-R at a single institution were identified. Patients completed an institutional Lower-Extremity Assessment Protocol (LEAP) testing protocol at 6 and 9 months postoperatively. Extension strength and flexion strength of the ipsilateral and contralateral limbs and limb symmetry index (LSI) were compared between the 6- and 9-month testing outcomes. Subgroup analysis compared patients demonstrating less than or greater than 10% change in contralateral limb flexion and extension strength between 6 and 9 months postoperatively. Result(s): A total of 144 subjects were included in this study. On average, contralateral limb flexion and extension strength increased 2-4% between 6 and 9 months postoperatively. However, the contralateral limb increased >10% from 6 to 9 months in extension and flexion strength in 35/144 (24.3%) and 55/144 (38.2%) of patients, respectively. The cohort with >10% change between 6 and 9 months had significantly weaker contralateral extension and flexion strength at 6 months compared to the cohort that demonstrated <10% change (extension: 2.00 vs 2.39; P < .001; flexion: 0.84 vs 1.08; P < .001), but similar ipsilateral limb performance. Therefore, the >10% change cohort had a significantly greater LSI at 6 months compared to the <10% change cohort (67.3% vs 59.4%; P = .006). No demographic or operative factors correlated with which patients demonstrated >10% flexion or extension strength changes of the contralateral limb. Conclusion(s): A large percentage of patients demonstrate significant changes in their contralateral limb flexion and extension strength between 6 and 9 months postoperatively that result from an initial contralateral limb strength deficit. This may limit the utility of the contralateral limb as a control for comparison to the operative extremity during return to sport assessment.Copyright © 2022 The Authors

Background: Radiographic and cadaveric studies have suggested that anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) femoral tunnel drilling with the use of a flexible reaming system through an anteromedial portal (AM-FR) may result in a different graft and femoral tunnel position compared with using a rigid reamer through an accessory anteromedial portal with hyperflexion (AAM-RR). No prior studies have directly compared clinical outcomes between the use of these 2 techniques for femoral tunnel creation during ACLR. Purpose(s): To compare revision rates at a minimum of 2 years postoperatively for patients who underwent ACLR with AM-FR versus AAM-RR. The secondary objectives were to compare functional testing and patient-reported outcomes between the cohorts. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Method(s): Included were consecutive patients at a single academic institution between 2013 and 2018 who underwent primary ACLR without additional ligamentous reconstruction. Patients were separated into 2 groups based on the type of anatomic femoral tunnel drilling: AM-FR or AAM-RR. Graft failure, determined by revision ACLR, was assessed with a minimum 2 years of postoperative follow-up. The authors also compared patient-reported outcome scores (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]) and functional performance testing performed at 6 months postoperatively. Result(s): A total of 284 (AAM-RR, 232; AM-FR, 52) patients were included. The mean follow-up time was 3.7 +/- 1.5 years, with a minimum 2-year follow-up rate of 90%. There was no significant difference in the rate of revision ACLR between the AAM-RR and AM-FR groups (10.8% vs 9.6%, respectively; P =.806). At 6 months postoperatively, there were no significant between-group differences in peak knee extension strength, peak knee flexion strength, limb symmetry indices, or hop testing, as well as no significant differences in IKDC (AAM-RR, 81.1; AM-FR, 78.9; P =.269) or KOOS (AAM-RR, 89.0; AM-FR, 86.7; P =.104). Conclusion(s): In this limited study, independent femoral tunnel drilling for ACLR using rigid or flexible reaming systems resulted in comparable rates of revision ACLR at a minimum of 2 years postoperatively, with no significant differences in strength assessments or patient-reported outcomes at 6 months postoperatively.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

OBJECTIVES: To compare clinical and functional outcomes of patients after primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using quadriceps tendon- (QT-A) and hamstring tendon (HT-A) autograft with a minimum follow-up (FU) of 5 years. METHOD(S): Between 2010 - 2014, all patients undergoing ACLR (QT: 119, HT: 511) were recorded in a prospectively administered database. All patients with primary, isolated QT-A ACLR and without any concomitant injuries or high grade of osteoarthritis were extracted from the database and matched to patients treated with HT-A. Re-rupture rates, anterior-posterior (ap) knee laxity, single-leg-hop test (SLHT) performance, distal thigh circumference (DTC) and patient reported outcome measurements (PROMs) were recorded. Between-group comparisons were performed using chi-square-, independent-samples T- or Mann-Whitney-U tests. RESULT(S): 45 QT-A patients were matched to 45 HT-A patients (n=90). The mean FU was 78.9+/-13.6 months. 18 patients (20.0%/QT: N=8, 17.8%; HT: n=10, 22.2%; p=.60) sustained a graft rupture and 17 subjects (18.9%/QT: n=9, 20.0%; HT: n=8, 17.8%; p= .79) suffered a contralateral ACL injury. In high active patients (Tegner-activity-level>=7) the rerupture rate increased to 37.5% (HT-A) and 22.2% (QT-A; p=.32). No statistical between-group differences were found in ap knee laxity side-to-side (SSD) measurements (QT-A: 1.9+/-1.2mm, HT-A: 2.1+/-1.5mm; p=.60), subjective IKDC- (QT: 93.8+/-6.8, HT: 91.2+/-7.8, p=.17), Lysholm- (QT: 91.9+/-7.2, HT: 91.5+/-9.7, p=.75) or any of the five subscales of the KOOS score (all p>.05). Furthermore, Tegner-activity-level (QT: 6(1.5), HT: 6(2), p=.62), VAS for pain (QT: 0.5+/-0.9, HT: 0.6+/-1.0, p=.64), Shelbourne-Trumper-Score (QT: 96.5+/-5.6, HT: 95.2+/-8.2, p=.50), Patient-and-Observer-Scar-Assessment-Scale (POSAS) (QT: 9.4+/-3.2, HT: 10.7+/- 4.9, p=.24), SSD-DTC (QT: 0.5+/-0.5, HT: 0.5+/-0.6, p=.97), return to sports rates (QT-A: 82.1%, HT-A: 86.7%) and SLHT (QT: 95.9+/-3.8%, HT-A: 93.7+/-7.0%) did not differ between groups. Donor site morbidity (HT-A n=14, 46.7%; QT-A n=3, 11.5%; p=.008) was significantly lower in the QT-A group. Five patients (11.1%) of the HT-group and three patients (6.7%) in the QT-group required revision surgery (p= .29). CONCLUSION(S): Patient-reported outcome measures, knee laxity, functional testing results and re-rupture rates are similar between patients treated with QT- and HT-autografts. However, patients with QT-autograft have smaller tibial skin incisions and lower postoperative donor site morbidity.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

BACKGROUND: Performance on strength and functional tests is often used to guide postoperative rehabilitation progress and return to activity decisions after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Clinicians may have difficulty in determining which criteria to follow if there is disagreement in performance outcomes among the tests., PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to compare pass rates between strength tests and single-leg hop (SLHOP) tests among men and women and between patients with lower and higher preinjury activity levels recovering from ACLR. We hypothesized that pass rates would be nonuniformly distributed among test types, sex, and activity level and that more participants would pass hop tests than strength tests., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3., METHODS: A total of 299 participants (146 men; 153 women)-at a mean of 6.8 +/- 1.4 months after primary, unilateral, and uncomplicated ACLR (mean age, 23 +/- 9.7 years; mean height, 172 +/- 10.5 cm; mean mass, 75.8 +/- 18.4 kg)-completed testing. Quadri.tif strength was evaluated using peak torque during isokinetic knee extension at 90 deg/s and 180 deg/s. Jump distance during the SLHOP and triple hop tests was measured (in cm). Strength and hop test measures were evaluated based on the limb symmetry index ((LSI) = (ACLR / contralateral side) x 100). We operationally defined "pass" as >90% on the LSI., RESULTS: Pass rates were nonuniformly distributed between isokinetic knee extension at 90 deg/s and the SLHOP test (chi2 = 18.64; P < .001). Disagreements between isokinetic testing at 90 deg/s and the SLHOP test occurred in 36.5% (109/299) of the participants. Among those who failed strength testing and passed hop testing, a greater portion reported higher activity levels before their injury (chi2 = 6.90; P = .01); however, there was no difference in pass rates between men and women. Similar patterns of disagreement were observed between all strength test and hop test outcomes., CONCLUSION: ACLR patients with higher activity levels may be more likely to pass hop testing despite failing quadri.tif strength testing. This may be an indicator of movement compensations to achieve jump symmetry in the presence of quadri.tif weakness.

Background: The relationship between meeting return-to-sport criteria and psychological readiness after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is unknown. Purpose(s): To examine (1) whether patients who met 1 of the criteria for return to sport had higher psychological readiness than those who did not meet any of the criteria and (2) if those who met more criteria had higher psychological readiness. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Method(s): This study included 144 patients who underwent unilateral ACL reconstruction. All patients had regularly participated in some sport activities before an ACL rupture. At 12 months postoperatively, each patient completed 3 knee function tests (isokinetic quadriceps strength, isokinetic hamstring strength, and single-leg hop distance) and 2 self-reported measures (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] 2000 subjective form and ACL-Return to Sport after Injury [ACL-RSI] scale); the ACL-RSI scale was used to measure psychological readiness to return to sport. The 4 criteria for return to sport were a limb symmetry index (LSI) >=90% for each of the 3 function tests in addition to an IKDC score >=90. Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine the association between meeting the individual criteria and the ACL-RSI score. In addition, the patients were divided into 5 groups according to the number of criteria met, and the Kruskal-Wallis and Steel-Dwass tests were used to compare the ACL-RSI scores among the groups. Result(s): Overall, 23 patients (16.0%) met none of the criteria for return to sport, 27 (18.7%) met 1 of the criteria, 34 (23.6%) met 2 criteria, 35 (24.3%) met 3 criteria, and 25 (17.4%) met all 4 criteria. Meeting the criteria for the hamstring strength LSI (P =.002), single-leg hop distance LSI (P =.004), and IKDC subjective score (P <.001) was each associated with higher ACL-RSI scores. Significant differences in ACL-RSI scores were found between patients who met none versus 2, 3, and 4 of the return-to-sport criteria (P <.001 for all) and between patients who met 1 versus 4 criteria (P <.001). Conclusion(s): Meeting return-to-sport criteria was positively associated with psychological readiness, and the patients who met multiple criteria had higher psychological readiness.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

Background: Timing for return to sport (RTS) after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is paramount for the avoidance of a secondary injury. A common criterion in RTS decision-making is the limb symmetry index (LSI) which quantifies (a)symmetries between the affected and unaffected limb. Limb dominance is one of many factors that may contribute to the recovery of the LSI after ACL reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to examine how limb dominance affects the LSI of functional performance tasks nine months following ACL reconstruction (time of RTS). Method(s): At time of return to sport, n = 100 patients (n = 48 injured the dominant limb, n = 52 injured the non-dominant limb, n = 34 female, n = 66 male) with ACL reconstruction surgery performed isokinetic strength measurements of the knee extensors and flexors, and drop jumps (DJ), single leg hop for distance (SHD) and 6 m timed hop (6MTH) testings. Result(s): The findings indicated that injury of the dominant leg led to significantly higher LSI values in maximal isokinetic knee extensor strength (p = 0.030). No significant differences were observed for maximal isokinetic knee flexor strength, DJ, SHD or 6MTH performance. Stratifying for sex revealed no significant differences. Simple regression analyses demonstrated that LSI in maximal knee extensor strength significantly predicted LSIs in DJ and SHD while explaining 14% and 18% of the respective variance. Conclusion(s): Given that limb dominance affects the LSI of muscle strength suggests that a differentiated interpretation of the LSI with respect to limb dominance should be considered for a safe return to sport. Monoarticular knee extensor strength and multiarticular hop test performance are interrelated and thus can show asymmetries which are not maladaptive but established during years of habituation or training.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).

Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using hamstring tendon (HT) graft aims to stabilise the knee, but it may bring some complications like anterior knee (AKP) pain that can have consequences on the functional aspect of this surgery. The aim of this study was to compare isokinetic knee strength and functional outcomes between patients with and without AKP following an ACLR using HT graft during the first-year post-surgery. Three hundred and thirty subjects operated by ACLR using hamstring tendon graft were included in our retrospective cohort and divided into two groups: a group with AKP (AKP+ group) and one without AKP (AKP-group). In our population, 14.8% of the patients had AKP. At 4 post-operative months, subjects with pain had lower isokinetic strength limb symmetry index (LSI) for knee flexors and extensors, and a lower Lysholm score than subjects without pain (p < 0.0001). These differences did not persist at 7 post-operative months, and there was no difference in the one-leg hop test. After multivariate analysis, we highlighted the impact of time on the evolution of these parameters. Yet, the exact definition of AKP after ACLR remains to be clearly defined since an imprecise diagnosis may lead to inappropriate management. Pre-operative information about this type of complication, which evolves favourably with time, could be useful for patients. Indeed, AKP can occur after ACLR, even if a HT graft has been used, compared to other surgical procedures using the knee extensor apparatus as patellar tendon graft (AKP is associated with the donor site morbidity). In case of AKP after ACLR, monitoring the muscle inhibition by isokinetic tests may enable clinicians to adapt the retraining and the return to sport. Copyright: © 2023 Chantrelle et al.

BACKGROUND: Between-leg symmetry in 1-leg hop and knee strength performances is considered important after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) to facilitate a safer return to sport. While few athletes with ACLR demonstrate symmetry in test batteries, reference data for noninjured athletes are lacking, thus questioning how ACLR-specific poor symmetry is., HYPOTHESIS: Athletes with ACLR (hamstring autograft) show lower symmetry and have a lower proportion of symmetric individuals than noninjured athletes for knee flexion strength but not for hop for distance, vertical hop, and knee extension strength., STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3., METHODS: A total of 47 athletes with ACLR (median 13.0 months post-ACLR) who had returned to their sport, and 46 noninjured athletes participated. Symmetry was calculated between the worse and better legs for each test and combinations of them using the limb symmetry index (LSIWORSE-BETTER, ranging from 0% to 100%). The 2 groups were compared for these values and the proportions of individuals classified as symmetric (LSIWORSE-BETTER >=90%) using independent t-tests and Fisher's exact tests, respectively., RESULTS: Athletes with ACLR were less symmetric than noninjured athletes for knee flexion strength with a lower LSIWORSE-BETTER (83% vs 91%, P < 0.01) and a lower proportion of symmetric individuals (39% vs 63%, P = 0.04). No differences between groups were revealed for the hop tests, knee extension strength, or combinations of tests (P > 0.05). Only 17% of the athletes with ACLR and 24% of the noninjured athletes demonstrated symmetric performances for all 4 tests., CONCLUSION: Athletes with ACLR (hamstring autograft) showed poorer symmetry in knee flexion strength than noninjured athletes, although both groups had few individuals who passed the test battery's symmetry criteria., CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Symmetry is uncommon among athletes irrespective of ACLR and should be considered regarding expected rehabilitation outcomes and return-to-sport decisions post-ACLR.

PURPOSE: To investigate the differences in maximal (isometric and concentric peak torque) and explosive (rate of torque development (RTD)) hamstring and quadriceps strength symmetry between males and females during early- and late-phase rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using hamstring tendon (HT) autografts and to determine the interaction of time and sex on maximal and explosive strength symmetry., METHODS: A total of 38 female and 51 male participants were assessed during early (3-6 months post-operative) and late (7-12 months post-operative) phases of rehabilitation following ACLR. Maximal (concentric and isometric peak torque) and explosive (isometric RTD) hamstring and quadriceps strength were assessed and presented as limb symmetry index (LSI)., RESULTS: Maximal concentric hamstrings asymmetry (Early: 86 +/- 14; Late 92 +/- 13; p = 0.005) as well as maximal concentric (Early, 73 +/- 15; Late 91 +/- 12; p < 0.001) and explosive (Early: 82 +/- 30; Late: 92 +/- 25; p = 0.03) quadriceps asymmetry decreased from early to late rehabilitation. However, there were no significant changes in maximal isometric quadriceps strength and explosive isometric hamstring strength in the same time period. Females had a larger asymmetry in maximal concentric (Females: 75 +/- 17; Males: 81 +/- 15; p = 0.001) and explosive (Females: 81 +/- 32; Males: 89 +/- 25; p = 0.01) quadriceps strength than males throughout rehabilitation. There were no sex differences in maximal and explosive hamstring strength. There were no sex by time interactions for any variables., CONCLUSION: Explosive hamstring strength asymmetry did not improve despite recovery of maximal hamstring strength during rehabilitation following ACLR with HT autografts. While sex did not influence strength recovery, females had larger maximal and explosive quadriceps strength asymmetry compared to males throughout rehabilitation following ACLR., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.
